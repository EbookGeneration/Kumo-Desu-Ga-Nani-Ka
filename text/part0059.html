        <h2>059 - The defensive battle of 100 meters above ground ⑤</h2>
        <p>The monkeys advance on. I keep scattering the threads there. It was like reproducing the first time. However, there are altered parts too.</p>
        <p>The monkeys have already understood the property of my threads. That it's impossible to escape once caught. Therefore, the monkey that advanced at the head extend it's body intentionally and invades the thread area. To stick the threads of a wider range on itself. To make the following monkeys to be able to proceed easier.</p>
        <p>For that reason, several monkeys lay spread-eagle on the wall. Moreover, in preparation for the big fall of threads, they stick on the wall solidly. Like that, the path of the monkeys is made and the following monkeys advance. The following monkeys also throw themselves once receiving my threads. The desperate strategy that was violated for insanity without concerning themselves. Despite all that, I'm astonished because they can think of a strategy precisely. It's really tough.</p>
        <p>But, no matter how many countermeasures you used, as long as it consist of sacrifices, the more they advance, the more the number of monkeys will decrease. Since the huge monkey appeared, the reinforcement stopped coming. If it proceed as it is now, the monkeys will be exterminated before reaching me. That is if the huge monkey doesn't move.</p>
        <p>I continue to be cautious of the huge monkey. I must be cautious of that one while fighting the monkeys. It's a work that wear down my nerves considerably. Thanks to that, the skill level of "Concentration" rose again.</p>
        <p>And, finally, there was a movement from the huge monkey. The one who moves is the guy with the lowest level. It turns around and withdraws to the back. Although it's good that it would just leave, life is not that easy. When the huge monkey turns around facing here, it started running straight.</p>
        <p>Don't tell me!? When thinking that it's possible, my intuition strikes a warning. I prepare for the interception immediately.</p>
        <p>As expected, what I thought came true. The huge monkey applied an approach run to jump over the lump of threads. And, with a dreadful jumping power, it jumped to me at a stretch.</p>
        <p>I hurl the Cast Net that I managed to prepared in time at the jumping huge monkey. It can't avoid it in the air and the huge monkey got caught in the Cast Net disappointingly. The trajectory of the huge monkey shifted slightly downward by having caught in the Cast Net. It crashes into the wall right under me. It gets entangled in the thread with a dull sound and stops in the state stuck to the wall.</p>
        <p>The huge monkey revives from that state immediately and begins to act violently to escape from the threads. Without delay, I added threads on it while creating Spider Poison using "Poison Synthesis" and I dropped it at the big mouth. The huge monkey writhes in agony because of the double pain of thread and poison. I use "Poison Synthesis" once more while being impatient that it didn't die in one Spider Poison. The drops of poisonous water enter the big mouth neatly.</p>
        <p>{Experience points has reached a certain degree.

        <p>I understood that the huge monkey died because a level rose. I throw off the old skin hastily. I can't afford to feel relieved now.</p>
        <p>I turned around towards the invading monkeys, and the one of the huge monkey was there.</p>
        <p>Taking the advantage when I was busy with the huge monkey that has jumped over a little while ago, it has already crawl up here using the same route as the monkey. Fast!? It should have been on the ground a little while ago, but it has come this far. The monkeys that became the path of the huge monkey were crushed without mercy. It has the leg strength and grip strength to that extent, and it ran the whole distance to here in the blink of an eye.</p>
        <p>I release a thread at the huge monkey in a hurry. The huge monkey avoids it quickly even though it's on a vertical wall. But, there's no path of the monkeys ahead it. My threads covered all over the wall stickily there.</p>
        <p>The huge monkey sticks on the wall. Although it struggles to tear it off immediately, it seems that my threads can't be removed easily even with the power of the huge monkey. But, the wall begins to produce a disturbing sound earlier than the thread.</p>
        <p>Of course, I will never allow such a thing. I added threads all over it immediately and I leave it as it is. It should be able to last for a while.</p>
        <p>I return my eyes immediately. The second one have moved, so that means, the third one must be moving already. The prediction was proved right. I found the third one immediately.</p>
        <p>The approaching figure was just about to close its mouth towards me now.</p>
        <p>!!? It's no longer the time to be concern of falling anymore. Or rather, I moved reflexively without thinking. I jump into the air from the footing.</p>
        <p>I was not able to avoid it, and my legs on the right side and a part of my body were crunched. My HP decreases at a stretch. Together with a terrible pain, my consciousness blinks. But, if I lose my consciousness here, then I will never wake up anymore.</p>
        <p>I fire a thread hastily in the air. The thread that sticks to the wall prevents my fall. But, I struck against the wall in reaction and I almost lose my consciousness for an instant. I clench my fangs and hold on to my consciousness.</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Acquired skill [Faint Resistance LV1]}</p>
        <p>Wondering whether or not it's because of the new skill, I somehow manage to hold on to my consciousness. I turn my eyes towards the place where the footing is.</p>
        <p>The third huge monkey destroyed the footing and was caught in the ruins of threads. It's natural. There's no way that I would make a normal footing. When the time comes, the footing is made to be able to become a trap. But, I didn't thought that it would be destroyed by a blow.</p>
        <p>I move to the top. Because half of my legs disappeared, I moved using "Thread Manipulation" to pull me up. I moved up further than the raging huge monkey. I make full use of "Thread Manipulation" to restrict the huge monkey and fix it to open its big mouth. I synthesis Spider Poison using "Poison Synthesis" and let the huge monkey swallow it.</p>
        <p>{Experience points has reached a certain degree.

Skill [Agility LV1] has become [Agility LV2]}<br/>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Endurance LV1] has become [Endurance LV2]}<br/>{Skill points gained}</p>
        <p>Shedding of skin by level up. Fuu. I thought I was gonna die. That one just now was really dangerous. I might be seriously dead if I didn't level up.</p>
        <p>But, it's until here. Because the second one seems to break out of the restriction soon, more threads were added. Because the huge monkey crushed their precious path, the monkeys didn't advance as much as I expected. It looks like I can still recover the time I have used to fight against the huge monkeys. If they still have any cards to play, then it's a different story, but right now, the monkeys have no way to reverse this situation.</p>
        <p>Even so, I can't be careless. Because of that, I have experienced a lot of painful experiences. I don't intend to relax till the end.</p>
