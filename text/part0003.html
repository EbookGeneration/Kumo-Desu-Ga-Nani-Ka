        <h2>003 - There was a time when I thought that "Appraisal" was a cheat skill.</h2>
        <p>I am a spider. ( TL note: she uses 吾輩/wagahai to refer herself here) I'm still nameless.</p>
        <p>What am I saying suddenly? I just want to say it just because I don't have a name. What am I referring to? To explain about it, I need to look back on the past.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>I was dumbfounded after confirming my size. Well, isn't it normal? It's already a shock to me that I was born as a spider, furthermore, I'm a monster. This sucks. A normal person would had fall in despair and commit suicide already. Well, I haven't thought of wanting to die yet.</p>
        <p>But I can't keep on feeling down. If here is not Earth and it's in a different world, then I don't know how dangerous this world is. There's no guarantee that there are no other monsters besides that huge spider.</p>
        <p>That huge spider probably is about 30 meters in length according to my size.</p>
        <p>Can a person defeat that thing? I pray for the owner of the footprints to not meet that huge spider. However, things are different when they have heavy firearms. In addition, there's a possibility where magic exist in the world. If that's the case, then can they resist against that huge spider to some extent? I don't know. But that spider is definitely looks like a formidable enemy of the boss-type enemy. Or rather, if I'm wrong, I would be dead.</p>
        <p>A while ago, I was assuming that the people will fight with that huge spider but isn't it good that way? After all, I am probably the child of that huge spider. I'm the baby of a monster. Ah, un. Now's not the time to joke around. If somebody were to meet me, isn't it obvious that I'm going to be killed?</p>
        <p>It's possible. Or rather, the possibility being killed is high. What shall I do now? Even though I want some information about human, I will be killed if I were to be discovered.</p>
        <p>Un. This is bad. The lesser the information, the more I don't understand. What kind of world is this? What kind of people live in this world? How do they treat monsters like me in this world?</p>
        <p>There's a lot I want to know about but I don't have the way to find it out. Ah, if this was a novel then there should be a "Appraisal" skill for me to gather information.</p>
        <p>《 Currently you have 100 skill points. The skill [Appraisal LV1] can be acquired by spending 100 skill point. Do you want to acquire it? 》</p>
        <p>.... Seriously? Suddenly, I heard a voice in my head sounded like a machine. Oh, I see. There is. There is a "Appraisal" skill! Fuhyoii! I'm fired up! It somehow became like a different world reincarnation already! My answer is obviously a YES!</p>
        <p>{ [Appraisal LV1] was acquired. Remaining skill point 0 }</p>
        <p>Even though I used all my skill point, such points would surely increase by the time I level up so there's no need to worry about that. Leaving. That. Aside! I should check out my "Appraisal" skill by examining various things!</p>
        <p>.... How to use it? Well, for now, I should try focusing on a rock while chanting "Appraisal" in my mind. Mmmmm! I feel that it went well! Information flowed quickly into my head.</p>
        <p>[ Stone ]</p>
        <p>........Hmm? Huh? That's all? No no no, You can't mean it right? I most likely failed for the first time. Let's try again.</p>
        <p>[ Stone ]</p>
        <p>.........Eh? Don't tell me, it's only that? No no no no. Surely, this rock has no information value in it. Therefore, I am sure it's just a plain rock. Now, I will try to appraise the wall. By any chance, I might be able to know what kind of place is this. I would feel ease if there's a name and explanation about the cave after appraising it.</p>
        <p>[ Wall ]</p>
        <p>........... I won't say anything this time.</p>
        <p>[ Appraisal LV1 ]. Purposely attaching a LV, I think I need to put a little more thought about it. In other words, the skill won't have much effect in LV1. Even though, I want to raise the LV, I don't have skill points to be used.</p>
        <p>Uwaaa! It have wasted all my skill points! I don't know what kind of skill there is other than "Appraisal" but there should be a skill much more usable even in LV1!</p>
        <p>No, I should think oppositely. If "Appraisal" is in this kind of state, then other skill should have a useless effect in LV1 too. Let's think this way. Otherwise, I cannot continue.</p>
        <p>Haaa. Nai waa. While I am on it, should I appraise myself?</p>
        <p>『 Spider No name』</p>
        <p>Hmm? It is as expected that spider appeared after appraising but.. no name?</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>That sums up everything and it's back to the beginning. No name. Well, I have a name in my previous life so does that mean that the present me as a spider do not have a name?</p>
        <p>For the time being, I will put away this useless "Appraisal" skill. Or rather, I should say that it became more complicated due to the "Appraisal" skill.</p>
        <p>Skill point. I can probably acquire new skills if I save some points. But I don't know how to gain the points. If this world uses the concept of LV, then I should be able to gain some points by LV up. If it's like that though.</p>
        <p>This world is like a game having LV, skill and points. Isn't it fine like this? At most, I am just a spider monster. I can't possibly live a decent life. Ah. In the first place, I am just a spider. I will probably be living a spider life ( 蜘蛛生 ) rather than a human life ( 人生 ). Anyways, in this game-like world, born as a spider, I should live my live amusingly as a spider in such a world just like playing a game.</p>
        <p>For the time being, I am hungry.</p>
