        <h2>087 - I'm going to evolve! Part 3</h2>
        <p>[Poison Taratect：Evolution Condition：Small Poison Taratect LV10：Explanation：The rare species adult of the spider-type monster called the Taratect. It has very powerful poison]</p>
        <p>I appraise the Poison Taratect too. But, if I were to evolve, it would be the other one. Zoa Ere. It has strict conditions to evolve, and above all, from what Appraisal-sama said, it seems to have a high combat ability. It's also small.</p>
        <p>Guessing from the name and the explanation, I feel uneasy that I will evolve into a different species from the Taratect species. If I evolve as the Taratect species, it's certain that I will become stronger. After all, I have witnessed the evolution form with my eyes. My mother which is the super-huge spider. The Greater Taratect witnessed in the lower layer. Although it's unimaginable from the weak me, I understand that I will reach that area if I keep evolving.</p>
        <p>Although I understand, I will get bigger if I evolve into it. Although it's said that better too big than too small, I think that miniaturization is the mainstream. Small but highly efficient. I will aim at that! If I get bigger, it's harder to move. How big is the space needed for my mother to act properly? I would like to avoid that I can't pass through the passage that I was able to pass suddenly.</p>
        <p>Try get bigger in this place covered with magma. I can picture that I will miss my step carelessly in a thin passage! It won't be "pond *splash*", but it will be "magma *splash*! I will die! Although I don't know how big I will become when I turn into an adult, in my case, the demerit is big if I grow bigger.</p>
        <p>It's not only that it will become impossible to pass through passages, but also in the significance of combat. After all, I'm specialized in "Evasion". If it's big, the target will also be big. If I'm specialized in "Evasion", then being small is better. Besides, becoming bigger means that I will gain weight. My movement will become slower if I'm heavy. You want me who has speed as life to become slower? No way.</p>
        <p>Thus, I don't want to evolve into the Taratect species. When there's another species that appeared there, of course I would want to choose that.</p>
        <p>It doesn't mean that I don't have worries. Although it's certain that the evolution of the Taratect species is strong, the Zoa Ere evolution is not necessarily strong. Worst case, the evolution of Zoa Ere stops at there. In that case, it might be better to work hard to become stronger as the Taratect species.</p>
        <p>Well, if that happens, it can't be helped. Status can be improved by level up, and it's possible to improve it by training. Even a weak monster will surely become strong someday if it's raised with love. Like me. No, really, when comparing it with my beginning status, I have become quite strong. When I experienced the weakness of me who can die with a strike at the beginning, I think I can somehow do something about most adversities.</p>
        <p>Thus, let's evolve into Zoa Ere.</p>
        <p>The problem is how to evolve safely, but I have thought about the countermeasures. Although there's still uneasiness when you ask whether it's safe or not, it's better than nothing. Thus, come on, Eel's corpse-san!</p>
        <p>Today's 3 minute setting. The thing prepared here is the eel's corpse. It's the finest quality. First of all, this is extended. Next, round it from the tail. Be careful to roll the coil beautifully. This time, it's important to leave some space at the center. When the circle is drawn, make sure to pile the eel's body up. And on top of it, roll the coil again. Don't do it from the outside. Work from the inside of the coil. This is repeated, and it will be completed when the head is placed on the center.</p>
        <p>The completion of the eel shelter. Uwaa, it's made well!</p>
        <p>Yosh. The eel must be very hard because it has "Dragon Scale". It won't be damaged by just a scratch, so I can expect from it even though it's not as good as my nest. If it's here, it shouldn't be a problem to evolve.</p>
        <p>Let's steel myself and go.</p>
        <p>{Individual Small Poison Taratect evolves into Zoa Ere}</p>
        <p>Yes. And, suddenly, my consciousness get distant.</p>
