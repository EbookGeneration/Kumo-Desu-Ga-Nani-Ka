        <h2>090.1 - K1 Pessimistic Duke's daughter</h2>
        <p>"Sensei, wasn't that too much today?"<br/>"No it's not"<br/>"It's insignificant to say that it was Sue's killing intent, and it's not like Shun activated "Appraisal" with malice"<br/>"Katia-chan is also boxed. Did you know that an intimidation is considered as a killing intent in the dangerous area?"<br/>"Is it such a thing..."<br/>"Especially, "Appraisal" must not be used thoughtlessly. If the person has "Appraisal" or a person with good intuition, then the person will know that he has been appraised. When you met with Potimas for the first time, did you feel any strange feeling?"<br/>"Ah, that unpleasant feeling. So, that was the feeling of being appraised"<br/>"That's right. Depending on the situation, that alone can determine the hostility intention of a person. Well, when you are in a dangerous area, it's better to think that everyone except your comrades are enemies, but it's unrelated"<br/>"Depending on the situation, kill without questioning?"<br/>"Yes"<br/>"Did Sensei"<br/>"Because there's no benefit in the question beyond this point for both of us, let's stop this. Even though I say that, this will become the answer for Katia-chan who's good at conjectures"<br/>"Is that so? That shows how much Sensei has done"<br/>"It's so"<br/>"And, can't we meet the students that Sensei has gathered up yet?"<br/>"You can't"<br/>"The reason?"<br/>"That also, Sensei can't tell"<br/>「Say, Sensei. Is it true that 12 people are protected? How did you find them in this wide world? If I don't know that, I will even doubt that whether everyone is really alive or not」 "If Sensei lie at there, then it's okay that Sensei will drink 1000 of needles. Although the method is a secret, there's no lie in the protected number and the discovered number"<br/>"Then, how about the undiscovered? Sensei, please answer it honestly. Among the undiscovered 6 people, how many of them really can't be discovered?"<br/>"... Two people. Death is confirmed to the four remaining people"<br/>"... Is that so?"<br/>"I'm sorry"<br/>"It's not something that Sensei has to apologize. Can I ask it? The name of those who died"<br/>"Hayashi Kouta-kun, Wakaba Hiiro-san, Kogure Naofumi-kun, Sakurasaki Issei-kun. The four people"<br/>"... I see. But, if that's the case, then I can understand that the search is almost discontinued"<br/>"We are still searching for the remaining 2 people"<br/>"Say, why did the Elves help so much in the search? Although Sensei has explained the circumstances to the Elves, can the Elves be trusted?"<br/>"About that, Sensei can only ask you to believe in Sensei"<br/>"Are there such a lot of secrets?"<br/>"Including that"<br/>"I'm not the person who will believe a person by intuition like Shun. I want to believe in Sensei, but as long as Sensei continues to keep the secrets, I can't believe in Sensei from the bottom of my heart"<br/>"Sensei thinks that it's correct. Shun is just too honest"<br/>"Agreed. Because there are times when I think that I must be with him"<br/>"Oh? Oh oh oh? This, even if it's still not a sprout, it looks like there's a seed? If it becomes like that, it's amusing"<br/>"Eh?  What did you say? Sensei, what's with that disgusting smile? Because Sensei's appearance is a beauty little girl, if you look at me with such disgusting smile, I will unpleasant"<br/>"Divine punishment"<br/>"Gaha!?"<br/>

        <p>"Katia"<br/>"What is it?"<br/>"What's the relationship between Katia and Nii-sama?"<br/>"We are friends. What's wrong with it?"<br/>"Lie. You are not just a friend, right? That Elf called Sensei is also the same. The Saint and the next Sword Emperor are also the same. What are you guys?"<br/>"Is that something that should be heard from my mouth?"<br/>"What do you mean?"<br/>"Is the answer that you really want to hear is my answer, I wonder?"<br/>"That's..."<br/>"You should ask Shun himself. You won't be content even if you hear it from my mouth"<br/>"It might be so"<br/>"I intend to understand a little of the feelings that you are holding now. That's why, I think that you should express this feelings to the person himself"<br/>"... I understand. Sorry. And, thank you"<br/>"My pleasure"<br/>
        </p>
        <p>"Although I completely throw it to him, this much should be okay. I mean, this is their sibling's problem. Even though I'm unrelated, I got involved in it. Yes, I'm unrelated. I'm unrelated.......... I should say this to Shun tomorrow"<br/>

        <p>"Ooshima-kun, why are you mixed in the girl's changing room in a dignified manner?"<br/>"Eh?... Ah. Sorry. Because I have been living here for quite a long time already, I didn't consider about that. If it worries Hasebe-san, then I can either delay my time or I can just change in a different place"<br/>"Eh, ah, un"<br/>"No, why are you behaving in a strange way?"<br/>"Ah, un. Because I didn't thought that you will answer calmly. At such time, isn't it normal that a person will panic and explain?"<br/>"No, after I am reborn, I can't feel the charm in the girl's body anymore. It's like a lie that I'm dazed by it when I was a man. That's why, I don't feel anything when I look at a girl's body. Thanks to that, I can't feel such guilt"<br/>"Hee. Don't you think that it's a little embarrassing?"<br/>"When being born as the Duke's daughter, from changing clothes to bath care, it's all done by the maid, you know? My shame has flied somewhere"<br/>"I-I see. That seems to be hard"<br/>"Ah. Therefore, the dormitory life is comfortable. I believe that the other ojou-sama will complain because of the inconvenience that they don't have their maid"<br/>"Ah. I also think so"<br/>"Ah, and? Should I change in a different place?"<br/>"Ah, hmm. Somehow after hearing Ooshima-kun's story, I think it's okay. I have to get used to it eventually, so it's fine as it is"<br/>"Is it fine?"<br/>"Un. I'm a senior as a woman. It's my mission to guide people. Leave it to me!"<br/>「D-Don't be too hard on me」</p>
