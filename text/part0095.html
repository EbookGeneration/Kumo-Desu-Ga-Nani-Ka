A little while after I'm determined to become stronger, I found the next prey at last.<table><thead><tr><th colspan="4"><span>Elro Debegiad</span><span>LV4</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th colspan="4">Status</th></tr><tr><td>HP</td><td>103 / 103</td><td>Average Offensive Ability</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>MP</td><td>41 / 41</td><td>Average Defensive Ability</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>SP</td><td>76 / 76</td><td>Average Magic Ability</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td/><td>69 / 69</td><td>Average Resistance Ability</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"/><td>Average Speed Ability</td><td>41</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th colspan="4">Skill</th></tr><tr><td>Swim </td><td>LV2</td><td colspan="2">Heat Nullity</td></tr></tbody></table>
It's a monster of a strange appearance like a round globe with four feet.<br/>
Although I call it as the round insect, to be frank, this guy is weaker than the seahorse.<br/>
However, there's a troublesome thing about this guy that's this guy will escape to the magma immediately when it senses danger.<br/>
Therefore, it's necessary to kill it quickly while it's on the land.<br/>
<br/>
It's on the land now, so either one-hit kill, or paralyze it using poison with paralysis attribute.<br/>
Let's use the Deadly Spider Poison that satisfy both conditions.<br/>
<br/>
I spring out from the shadow of the rock, and approach it quickly.<br/>
I activate my "Poison Synthesis" before it senses my existence.<br/>
Although I don't know where's the mouth of the round insect, I will just pour it for now.<br/>
<br/>
The round insect's HP became 0 immediately.<br/>
Already!?<br/>
Weak!?<br/>
<br/>
《Experience points has reached a certain degree. Individual, Zoa Ere LV1 has become LV2》<br/>
《Every basic ability rose》<br/>
《Level Up Bonus:Skill Proficiency was acquired》<br/>
《Skill proficiency reached. Skill 『Enhanced Slashing LV2』 has become 『Enhanced Slashing LV3』》<br/>
《Skill proficiency reached. Skill 『SP Consumption Down LV3』 has become 『SP Consumption Down LV4』》<br/>
《Skill points gained》<br/>
<br/>
Oh, well, level up as planned, no problem, no problem.<br/>
Though I'm surprise that it's too weak.<br/>
<br/>
Let's pull myself together and confirm my status.<table><thead><tr><th colspan="4"><span>Zoa Ere</span><span>LV2</span><span>No name</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th colspan="4">Status</th></tr><tr><td>HP</td><td>215 / 215 (level up: 20)</td><td>Average Offensive Ability</td><td>269 (level up: 18)</td></tr><tr><td>MP</td><td>311 / 311 (level up: 20)</td><td>Average Defensive Ability</td><td>369 (level up: 18)</td></tr><tr><td>SP</td><td>215 / 215 (level up: 20)</td><td>Average Magic Ability</td><td>255 (level up: 10)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>215 / 215 + 399 (level up: 20)</td><td>Average Resistance Ability</td><td>390 (level up: 10)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"/><td>Average Speed Ability</td><td>1342 (level up: 70)</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th colspan="4">Skill</th></tr><tr><td>Automatic HP Recovery </td><td>LV6</td><td colspan="2">Patience</td></tr><tr><td>MP Recovery Speed </td><td>LV4</td><td colspan="2">Pride</td></tr><tr><td>MP Consumption Down </td><td>LV3</td><td>Overeating </td><td>LV9</td></tr><tr><td>SP Recovery Speed </td><td>LV3</td><td>Night Vision </td><td>LV10</td></tr><tr><td>SP Consumption Down </td><td>LV4</td><td>Visible Range Expansion </td><td>LV2</td></tr><tr><td>Enhanced Destruction </td><td>LV2</td><td>Destruction Resistance </td><td>LV2</td></tr><tr><td>Enhanced Slashing </td><td>LV3</td><td>Blow Resistance </td><td>LV2</td></tr><tr><td>Enhanced Poison </td><td>LV4</td><td>Slash Resistance </td><td>LV3</td></tr><tr><td>Fighting Spirit </td><td>LV2</td><td>Fire Resistance </td><td>LV2</td></tr><tr><td>Vitality Granting </td><td>LV2</td><td>Deadly Poison Resistance </td><td>LV2</td></tr><tr><td>Deadly Poison Attack </td><td>LV3</td><td>Paralysis Resistance </td><td>LV4</td></tr><tr><td>Corrosion Attack </td><td>LV1</td><td>Petrifaction Resistance </td><td>LV3</td></tr><tr><td>Poison Synthesis </td><td>LV8</td><td>Acid Resistance </td><td>LV4</td></tr><tr><td>Thread Talent </td><td>LV3</td><td>Corrosion Resistance </td><td>LV3</td></tr><tr><td>Universal Thread </td><td>LV1</td><td>Faint Resistance </td><td>LV3</td></tr><tr><td>Thread Manipulation </td><td>LV8</td><td>Fear Resistance </td><td>LV8</td></tr><tr><td>Throw </td><td>LV7</td><td colspan="2">Heresy Nullity</td></tr><tr><td>3D-Maneuver </td><td>LV5</td><td colspan="2">Pain Nullity</td></tr><tr><td>Concentration </td><td>LV10</td><td>Pain Alleviation </td><td>LV7</td></tr><tr><td>Thought Acceleration </td><td>LV4</td><td>Enhanced Vision </td><td>LV9</td></tr><tr><td>Foresight </td><td>LV4</td><td>Enhanced Hearing </td><td>LV8</td></tr><tr><td>Parallel Thought </td><td>LV9</td><td>Enhanced Smell </td><td>LV7</td></tr><tr><td>High-speed Calculation </td><td>LV1</td><td>Enhanced Taste </td><td>LV7</td></tr><tr><td>Accuracy </td><td>LV8</td><td>Enhanced Touch </td><td>LV7</td></tr><tr><td>Evasion </td><td>LV7</td><td>Divinity Area Expansion </td><td>LV2</td></tr><tr><td>Appraisal </td><td>LV9</td><td>Life </td><td>LV9</td></tr><tr><td>Detection </td><td>LV10</td><td>Magic Amount </td><td>LV8</td></tr><tr><td>Stealth </td><td>LV8</td><td>Agility </td><td>LV9</td></tr><tr><td>Silent </td><td>LV2</td><td>Endurance </td><td>LV9</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Conviction</td><td>Herculean Strength </td><td>LV4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Hell</td><td>Solid </td><td>LV4</td></tr><tr><td>Heresy Magic </td><td>LV3</td><td>Protection </td><td>LV4</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow Magic </td><td>LV3</td><td>Idaten </td><td>LV3</td></tr><tr><td>Poison Magic </td><td>LV3</td><td>Taboo </td><td>LV7</td></tr><tr><td>Abyss Magic </td><td>LV10</td><td colspan="2">[n % I = W]</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Skill Points: 50</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th colspan="4">Title</th></tr><tr><td>Gross Feeder</td><td>Monster Killer</td><td>Merciless</td><td>Ruler of Patience</td></tr><tr><td>Blood Relative Eater</td><td>Poison Technique User</td><td>Monster Slaughterer</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Assassin</td><td>Thread User</td><td>Ruler of Pride</td><td/></tr></tbody></table>
Hmm?<br/>
Hmmm?<br/>
Huh?<br/>
Somehow, didn't the status increased considerably?<br/>
Up until now, I think that my status only increase by 1 each without "Pride" and growth corrections.<br/>
It increases more now, right?<br/>
Does this means that the growth value changed because I evolve?<br/>
<br/>
O-Ooh!<br/>
As expected from the species that has high combat ability!<br/>
I never thought that growth value by level up will evolve!<br/>
Amazing.<br/>
This is really amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, there's also 50 skill points!<br/>
Before, it was only 20 points, so it's 2.5 times!<br/>
I might be able to acquire evil eye on the next level up!<br/>
Uha!<br/>
This is good.<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
If it's like this, it probably won't be necessary to practice "Magic Manipulation" specially.<br/>
Ah, but, there's no loss in trying to acquire it myself.<br/>
I don't know whether evil eye can be acquire at 100 points or not, so it's still early to count chickens before they're hatched.<br/>
Un, I must not be in high spirits.<br/>
When I say "Hyahha", most of the time, nothing good happens.<br/>
<br/>
However, when I see my status again, it's considerably balance and it's unexpectedly stable.<br/>
Although it doesn't change that it's speed specialized, in addition to this, the defense and resistance rise by "Patience" makes my overall defense ability high.<br/>
Although attack looks lower than defense, the essential is the strength of the poison, so this is also high.<br/>
Attacks won't hit me easily because I'm evasion specialized, so even if it hits me, I'm tough.<br/>
Furthermore, I have "Poison Attack" that's a one-hit kill attack.<br/>
Huh?<br/>
When hearing it like this, aren't I the strongest?<br/>
No no.<br/>
I must not get carried away here.<br/>
I must go with a modest heart.<br/>
<br/>

Author note: I wrote the increased numerical value of the status. How is it?
