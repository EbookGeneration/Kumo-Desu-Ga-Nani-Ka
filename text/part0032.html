        <h2>032 - Growth period?</h2>
        <p>Sususususu. ( ススススス。)</p>
        <p>Basa! ( バサッ！)</p>
        <p>Guruguru. ( グールグール。)</p>
        <p>Chomp!</p>
        <p>Itadakimasu.</p>
        <p>{Experience points has reached a certain degree. Individual, Small Taratect LV1 has become LV2} {Every basic ability rose} {Level Up Bonus:Skill Proficiency was acquired} {Skill points gained}</p>
        <p>The level up came. Though I'm sad because no skills leveled up, but I will settle with this. Oh, I found a prey.</p>
        <p>Sususususu.</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Acquired skill [Spy LV1]}</p>
        <p>Basa!</p>
        <p>Guruguru.</p>
        <p>Chomp!</p>
        <p>Itadakimasu.</p>
        <p>Hmm? Didn't something different mixed in it? I think the voice of heaven said something. Un? Skill? Spy? Something like harder to be discovered by the enemy? Up until now, I have not been discovered before, so isn't it unnecessary? Well, I will take it if you're giving it to me.</p>
        <p>Oh, I found a prey.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>Sususususu.</p>
        <p>Basa!</p>
        <p>Guruguru.</p>
        <p>Chomp!</p>
        <p>{Conditions met. Title [Assassin] was acquired} {By the effects of the title [Assassin], skill [Spy LV1][Shadow Magic LV1] was acquired} {[Spy LV1] has unified with [Spy LV1]}</p>
        <p>Itadakimasu.</p>
        <p>Hmm? I heard something again. Title? Which reminds me that I didn't acquire any new titles since the time I acquired "Gross Feeder" and "Blood Relative Eater". I tried to acquire new titles by performing various mysterious dance, but in the end, I didn't acquire any new titles. An assassin. I think that I'm becoming like a ninja.</p>
        <p>Oops, found a prey.</p>
        <p>Sususususu.</p>
        <p>Basa!</p>
        <p>Guruguru.</p>
        <p>Chomp!</p>
        <p>{Conditions met. Title [Monster Killer] was acquired} {By the effects of the title [Monster Killer], skill [Powerful LV1][Solid LV1] was acquired}</p>
        <p>Itadakimasu.</p>
        <p>Oh? I heard something once again. Monster Killer? No, but I have been killing monsters all the time in this dungeon. Why now? Is it that? Something like title acquisition after defeating a number of monsters. Un.</p>
        <p>Fua!? Found a prey again!</p>
        <p>Sususususu.</p>
        <p>Basa!</p>
        <p>Guruguru.</p>
        <p>Chomp!</p>
        <p>Itadakimasu.</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Acquired skill [Overeating LV1]}</p>
        <p>Again? Today is somehow amazing. I mean, what's this "Overeating". How is it a skill name? This, don't tell me it's a skill with negative effect?</p>
        <p>Ah, but I ate. Since evolution, I have not become full at all, but finally, my stomach becomes full. Looks like that mysterious phenomenon of food disappears as soon as I eat is just limited to after evolution. Good. If I still have that different dimension stomach, then something terrible will happen on the Engel's coefficient. Well, I don't have money, so there's no Engel's coefficient. I'm penniless.</p>
        <p>.......Let's wait a minute. I feel hungry and pass through various things, didn't 'that' do 'that' very hard today? 'That' did 'that' and because it's 'that', it's 'that'.</p>
        <p>Un. Let's calm down.</p>
        <p>My level rose. That's good. If I hunt, sooner or later it will increase, so it's not strange that it increase.</p>
        <p>I got "Spy" skill. That's also good. When saying it's useful or not, well, it's better than nothing. If it's possible to get it, then I will get it.</p>
        <p>Title was acquired. Isn't this weird? No, is it good to acquire a title? Is it very good? But getting 2 in succession.</p>
        <p>Err. "Assassin" and "Monster Killer". Both are dangerous title. Ah, I don't have any decent titles. I wonder why now.</p>
        <p>Well, "Assassin" is a ninja-like title. I acquired "Spy" and "Shadow Magic" from it. When it's called as "Shadow Magic", can I enter the shadow? A useful magic for assassination like hide oneself in the shadow. Either way, I can't use it. That's why I have said that I don't know the way to use magic! Ah, instruction manual please.</p>
        <p>I don't understand about the "Monster Killer". What? "Powerful" and "Solid"? I don't understand the skills because it's too vague. Un? If I think bluntly, is it a skill that increase the physical offensive ability and defensive ability in the status? Or maybe it's a support skill that raise status temporarily. If it's the former case, then it's good, but if it's the latter case, then I don't know the way to use it. After all, I have to leave it as it is.</p>
        <p>And lastly, "Overeating"? Isn't this really a negative skill? Even as a joke, saying something like overeating to a girl, I feel like want to fight against the voice of heaven! Do you want to say that I'm fat!? NO! Absolutely NO! It's just that after eating I become a little plump only! I will become slim back if I sleep overnight! Look at this slim leg! A beautiful leg that seems to break any moment! The stick-like leg which is impossible to be achieved by humans! Can you still say that I'm fat after that!? If it's not after meal, I would be thin!</p>
        <p>Fuu, fuu. ...It's futile. Nobody called me fat before in my previous life, so I reacted a little excessively. On the contrary, I have been called before as gari and bone. (TL note: ガリ/gari is an overly skinny person)</p>
        <p>Well, still, wasn't today a day with great progress? This is indeed the first time that I get various things. If possible, I want to continue this condition. Eh, promising? Obviously.</p>
