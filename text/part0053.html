        <h2>053 - I have become stronger even if it's a little</h2>
        <p>The skill level of "Severing Thread" rose to 3 because I kept tormenting the pill bug. Although I wanted to continue it more, there's no help for it because the pill bug has entered the state that's impossible to talk about without mosaic. Although it still can't leave a big wound at level 3, it's like piling up the garbage. Pill bug, I think that I probably won't forget you. Of course, I ate it after that. As usual, it was bad.</p>
        <p>When I think about it, it was not necessary to make the pill bug to accompany me. I can just hit the rock nearby. Oh dear, it's loss that the pill bug was killed? No no, I'm sure that the pill bug is crying with pleasure because I was benefited. Eh, fiend? I don't know what it is.</p>
        <p>And then, when I just finished tormenting the pill bug, I'm not sure whether or not I were drawn by the sound, but a different monster came.</p>
        <p>[Anogratch　LV8　Failed to appraise its status]</p>
        <p>It was a monster that I saw for the first time. It's a monkey-like monster measuring around 2 meters. Even the status appraisal failed and if possible, I want to pass through it, but it was not possible because I was found.</p>
        <p>Well, I managed to win somehow. Although it looks like the other party was the type that's confident in its own quickness, I was better. I kept dodging the attacking monkey's arm and I attacked it in an instant chance. And finally, I succeeded in capturing it with "Spider Thread".</p>
        <p>I was really scared. No, I'm serious. It's been a long time since I experience such serious battle. Moreover, this monkey is fairly strong. The sound when the arm swung is terrifying and it's not a laughing matter. I would die if it hits me. That's why, I avoided it desperately. If I had a mouth, I would scream. Kyaa? Of course, I would "kyaa!".</p>
        <p>I wonder whether or not I acquired a skill called "Evasion" because I kept avoiding desperately. When I appraise it, it was a skill that raises evasion. I did it, I acquired a speed specialization skill! Furthermore, I leveled up at the moment when I defeat the monkey.</p>
        <p>{Experience points has reached a certain degree. Individual, Small Taratect LV3 has become LV4}<br/>{Every basic ability rose}<br/>{Level Up Bonus:Skill Proficiency was acquired}<br/>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Concentration LV1] has become [Concentration LV2]}<br/>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Throw LV1] has become [Throw LV2]}<br/>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Accuracy LV1] has become [Accuracy LV2]}<br/>{Skill points gained}</p>
        <p>Three skills went up at a stretch. I'm very glad that all are simply useful skills. A level rose, and this is my status now.</p>

        <p>As usual, the status other than speed are low. If I don't have "Idaten", then my speed will also be low, and in that case, my merit will only be my threads. "Idaten" is useful in various ways.</p>
        <p>Although I'm glad that a lot rose at a stretch, it's bad to take it easy. There might be other monsters that got drawn besides the monkey. For the time being, I'll eat the monkey.</p>
        <p>Umu. This guy doesn't have poison. There's no bitterness. But, there's a peculiar bad smell and it's also not delicious. The cow and pig in my previous life were great.</p>
        <p>Although my stamina is full, it's not wasted thanks to the "Overeating" skill. When I first saw the "Overeating" skill, I thought it has a negative effect and I was considerably cautious of it, but it was a fairly good skill.</p>
        <p>Although I said it before, my stamina dependency is considerably high. My stamina is consumed when I release threads and when I'm running. Therefore, this skill that can stock stamina excessively has a good compatibility with me. If I can use magic, then the burden on my stamina might decrease a little, but there's no help for it to plead on nothing.</p>
        <p>Speaking of magic, I appraised the details of each magic spell.</p>
        <p>[Disturb：Plants discomfort directly into the soul] [Phantom Pain：Plants illusion pain directly into the soul] [Dark Shadow：The shadow thickens] [Poison Touch：Adds the poison attribute attack to the touched target]</p>
        <p>It looks like the effect of "Disturb" is just as its name, a mind attack. "Phantom Pain" and "Disturb" are both similar. Although "Poison Touch" seems to be a strong magic to learn at level 1, it's level 1 after all, so there might be a pitfall. "Dark Shadow" is just as it's name, but how to use it? Un. Like using it together with a higher level "Shadow Magic"? Then, this won't be useful when it's the only one.</p>
        <p>Well, either way, it's not usable. Now, that I have finished eating the monkey, let's move quickly.</p>
