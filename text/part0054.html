        <h2>054 - Quiet sleep great strategy!</h2>
        <p>Ah, sleepy. My sleepiness is getting quite dangerous soon. I never thought that camping without a simple home sounds to have so much effect. Although I thought I can endure a little more, it will be dangerous if I don't think of a way to sleep soundly soon.</p>
        <p>However, if it's possible to sleep soundly that easy, I won't forced myself to explore till I'm lacking of sleep. As expected, the Earth Dragon won't chase after me if I come here, but I'm in a situation where there are strong enemies everywhere. If it's a simple home, then it might be broke through.</p>
        <p>Even so, making a home with all my might is out of question. I don't want to set up a root here. I want to escape from here as soon as possible. For that reason, I must not make a home that needs a long time to make.</p>
        <p>When it becomes so, then I will have to make a simple home as before, but I don't know whether it has an effect on the inhabiting monsters or not. This turns out that I'm going around in circles.</p>
        <p>I strain my sleepy head and think about what to do. Even if it's a simple home, won't it go well depending on the way of doing it? For example, I don't make it at a random area, but I will hide myself at a place that's hard to be found and make it there. Even though I say it, the rocks around here are quite ragged. Even so, there's no such place that I can hide in peace.</p>
        <p>No, wait? Won't it go well even if I never hide? In short, isn't it enough if the monsters can't interfere? If so, then there's a good place.</p>
        <p>I go there at once. The ceiling, the point after climbing the wall all the time.</p>
        <p>Uhyoo. (　うひょー。) It's high. Scary. Can I have a quiet sleep like this? But, at present, I have not seen any monsters that can climb the wall or fly in the air. Ah, the snail insect is a different case. I have not seen any bees after reaching this wide space, so I thought that I will make a simple home between the wall and the ceiling and I will be safe if I sleep in there.</p>
        <p>Thus, let's start making the nest. Uwa, it's seriously high. If it's around 100 meters above ground, then how many floors is it in a skyscraper? I will surely die if I fall. Well, I don't think I will fall because I have a lifeline, but still, it's a scary thing to work exposed. Do your work, "Fear Resistance".</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Fear Resistance LV5] has become [Fear Resistance LV6]}</p>
        <p>I'm sorry. I said it irresponsibly. Therefore, don't insert a retort in such a perfect timing. Ah, it surprised me.</p>
        <p>F-for the time being, the border is completed. The border is made between the wall and the ceiling in a net with adhesion threads. In this border, I think I should make a bed like the hammock.</p>
        <p>Un. But, this is completely exposed to the outside, right? Won't it be an easy victim against long distance attack like the breath of Earth Dragon? As expected, I should cover it more. Can I somehow make use of the rocks scattered around here?</p>
        <p>I get down to the ground for the moment. I look at the rock. Un. It's huge if it's as it is. Can't I process(加工) it somehow? Can I cut a little with "Severing Thread"? I tie a thread to the rock and activate "Severing Thread". Pull. Hmm, although it cuts a little, it's no good. Will it work if I move it like a saw? Oh, even though it's a little, it's working.</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Severing Thread LV3] has become [Severing Thread LV4]}</p>
        <p>Thanks to the skill level rose midway, work efficiency rose. Yosh, the thinly cut rock is completed. I stick this on the surface of the nest and use it for camouflage.</p>
        <p>I stick a thread to the rock firmly. On top of that, I will climb to the nest 100 meters above ground while holding the thread. Yosh, now I just need to pull this thread. Fun! (　ふん！) H-heavy! Ugugugugu! Ku, I put my weight on. ( く、体重をかけるんだ。TL note: not too sure) Soore! (　そーれ！)</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Powerful LV2] has become [Powerful LV3]}</p>
        <p>The skill level of "Powerful" rose midway. Although it rose, it's still heavy. This consumes a lot of instantaneous force and stamina! This is hard!</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Agility LV1] was acquired}<br/>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Endurance LV1] was acquired}</p>
        <p>I acquired some skills. But, I don't have the time to confirm it now! Soore, pull!</p>
        <p>Zee, zee. (　ぜー、ぜー。) Haa. At last, I was able to lift the rock. Uwa, the stamina has decreased exceeding the stocks from the "Overeating". Ah, that's why, it's hard.</p>
        <p>Huh? This is strange. Although I should be thinking about the way to have a quiet sleep quickly, why am I doing such heavy labor diligently? Mmm? It's a defeat if I think deeply. Un.</p>
        <p>The rock is concealing the nest properly, so there's a result of my hard work. Now, I just need to make the bed and. Complete!</p>
        <p>Fuou. It's absolute heaven. Ah, after all, I can calm down in the thread. This is it. As expected, I can't sleep in peace without this.</p>
        <p>Ah, I must confirm the effect of the newly acquired skills before sleeping.</p>
        <p>[Agility：Increases SP(Agility) equivalent to the skill level] [Endurance：Increases SP(Endurance) equivalent to the skill level] [Small note: Agility = Yellow Gauge(Instantenous force), Endurance = Red Gauge(Total stamina)]</p>
        <p>Ah, it's the SP version of "Powerful" and "Sturdy". My SP which was 40 increases to 41 each. Stamina is important, so this is delicious.</p>
        <p>Yosh, now that I have confirmed the skills and I'm tired after the work, let's sleep! It seems that I'm able to sleep soundly after a long time, so let's sleep to my heart's content. Therefore, good night.</p>
