A gray-colored lizard-like monster measuring just a little over 1 meter in length. It petrifies its opponent with the basilisk inherent skill, "Magic Eyes of Petrifaction". In addition, it has poison. Furthermore, it can use "Earth Magic", although there's no opportunity to show it in the story. It uses the strategy where it shoots the soil made by the "Earth Magic", but there's no time to do it because it was caught in the nest. Taking the troublesome petrified condition into account, the danger degree is C.</p>
