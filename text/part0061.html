        <h2>061 - I'm going to evolve! Part 2</h2>
        <p>Well then, it's good that the monkeys have been exterminated, but what should I do in the future? For the time being, the surroundings are quiet. Other monsters didn't come near in spite of the noise here. It might avoid it because it's noisy. At any rate, it looks like there's time. It's hard to say that it's safe if I make a simple home near the ceiling again, but if it's a weak monster, it won't be able to approach.</p>
        <p>To be frank, I think that I can evolve if it's now. Although I don't know how long is the interval when I lose my consciousness after I evolve, judging from my sense before, I don't think it's a long time. It's just a sense, so I can't expect on it.</p>
        <p>Either way, whatever the case is, evolution is haunted by danger. Then, it doesn't looks like it's a good timing to evolve if I exclude the large amount of food that was secured unexpectedly. When saying whether I should evolve or not, I will absolutely evolve.</p>
        <p>Besides, if I assume that I don't evolve, I might stop at level 10. After I became level 10, I have killed a considerable number of monkeys. But, the level didn't rise after all. It's good if the experience points was insufficient, but there's a possibility that I may not grow anymore if I don't evolve. When thinking about it, I think I should acknowledge the risks and evolve.</p>
        <p>The problem is which one should I evolve. Taratect and Small Poison Taratect.</p>
        <p>Un. I don't know. Last time, there was a clear difference that is the deteriorating species and the normal species, but I don't know what to choose this time. I think that Taratect is probably the evolution to become an adult. But, it's unknown that how much I will change. I also don't know about the Poison. Because it's has 'Poison' on the name, it might strengthen the poison-type abilities, but how about the others?</p>
        <p>I'm at a loss. It would be good if "Appraisal" is possible at such time. "Appraisal", possible?</p>
        <p>Huh? At bottom of the appraisal result of the status, there's something that looks like an alert. Eh, evolution possible? What's this? The word "Evolution Possible" is blinking. Hmm? I double appraise it just in case.</p>
        <p>[Evolution Possible：Taratect or Small Poison Taratect]</p>
        <p>Wh...at!? Appraisal-san, are you serious!? You're the best! Yossha! With this, I can appraise my evolution! No, recently, Appraisal-san's function is not ordinary. I appraise it immediately.</p>
        <p>[Taratect：The standard adult form of the spider-type monster called the Taratect. Carnivorous and has poison in its fang] [Small Poison Taratect：The rare species hatchling of the spider-type monster called the Taratect. It has very powerful poison]</p>
        <p>I have decided it. The poison one. I mean, it's a rare species, you know? Rare, it's rare. I would obviously pick the rare one if you ask me to pick a standard or a rare. Japanese are weak against words like "rare" or "limited".</p>
        <p>Now that it's decided, I need to make a simple home first. Ah, I don't have much stamina left. Here, I should eat a nearby monkey and recover my stamina.</p>
        <p>Fuu, thank you for the meal. Well then, let's make a simple home.</p>
        <p>The empty rocky area, well, what can I say about it! An excellent cobweb is there! This time it's without rock. In this state where the monkeys stick all over the place, it won't be a camouflage even if I use the rock.</p>
        <p>However, I'm tired. Mentally and physically. After such a fierce battle, of course I will be tired. Although faint is different with sleeping, it feels like a short rest.</p>
        <p>{Individual Small Taratect evolves into Small Poison Taratect}</p>
        <p>Yes. Therefore, good night.</p>
