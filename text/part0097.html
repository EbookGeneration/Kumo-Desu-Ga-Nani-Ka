        <h2>097 - The eight passes</h2>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Enhanced Vision LV9] has become [Enhanced Vision LV10]}<br/>{Conditions met. Skill [Telephoto LV1] was derived from Skill [Enhanced Vision LV10]}</p>
        <p>Yosh! Finally, the skill level of "Enhanced Vision" reached the max level. The reward of reaching the max level of "Enhanced Vision" is a new derived skill. Let's appraise it immediately and examine its effect.</p>
        <p>[Telephoto：It becomes possible to see the distant scenery by magnification]</p>
        <p>Ah, it's exactly as stated. Mmm. Strange. The five senses skills are advantages plainly, but the derived skill is also plain. For the time being, let's activate it.</p>
        <p>Thus, Body in charge, activate "Telephoto"! Request acknowledged, "Telephoto" activate!</p>
        <p>Oh? Ooh? Oooh!? Ah, this is amazing. I'm sorry that I said that you are plain.</p>
        <p>An image magnified by "Telephoto" in my view and the image of my former view, these two deployed at the same time. Although I thought that all of my views magnified like the telescope, it looks like I can activate it with one eye. Although a person will be confused by the different information from the image usually, well, there are two of me. There's no confusion at all if I allot the work.</p>
        <p>Although the magnification rate is low and the range is short because its level is low now, it might be convenient if its level rises. For example, when "Detection" discovers an enemy lurking around, I can stare at it with "Telephoto" while securing normal view. Un un. This skill is also like a passive skill because there's no MP consumption. This seems to be quite useful, so I should keep it activated and raise its level.</p>
        <p>I know you are getting excited, but Information in charge. What is it, Body in charge? I found a prey in the scenery seen with "Telephoto". Ou, immediately useful, what a lovely guy. Should I kill it quickly? That goes without saying. Aye, aye, Sir.</p>
        <p>Thus, nearing the enemy quietly. Because it's impossible to use my sickle by the self-destruction of "Corrosion Attack" in the last time, I will pour Deadly Spider Poison on it using "Poison Synthesis". The monster's HP exhausted in an instant. It's power is dreadful as usual.</p>
        <p>{Experience points has reached a certain degree. Individual, Zoa Ere LV2 has become LV3}<br/>{Every basic ability rose}<br/>{Level Up Bonus:Skill Proficiency was acquired}<br/>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Visible Range Expansion LV2] has become [Visible Range Expansion LV3]}<br/>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Life LV9] has become [Life LV10]}<br/>{Conditions met. Skill [Life LV10] has evolved into Skill [Constitution LV1]}<br/>{Skill points gained}</p>
        <p>Oh, level up just came. My sickle has also recovered after shedding. And, finally, one of the status strengthening skills evolved. Let's appraise it.</p>
        <p>[Constitution：A bonus of skill level&times;10 is added to the HP. And, a growth correction equivalent to the skill level is added when level up]</p>
        <p>Should say that it's as expected? It's the same group as "Herculean Strength". That means, if the other status strengthening skills evolve, growth corrections will come together with it. If possible, I want to raise it earlier than usual, but I will have to endure until I escape from the middle layer. I want to go to somewhere safe quick.</p>
        <p>And, the long waited! My skill point became 100 by level up! Now, is there an evil eye-type skill added in the list?</p>
        <p>[Evil Eye of Curse（100）：Inflicts curse attribute damage to things that enter your line of sight] [Evil Eye of Extinction（100）：Inflicts corrosion attribute damage to things that enter your line of sight] [Evil Eye of Paralysis（100）：Inflicts paralysis attribute damage to things that enter your line of sight] [Evil Eye of Petrifaction（100）：Inflicts petrifaction attribute damage to things that enter your line of sight] [Evil Eye of Disturb（100）：Inflicts heresy attribute effect 「Disturb」 to things that enter your line of sight] [Evil Eye of Phantom Pain（100）：Inflicts heresy attribute effect  「Phantom Pain」 to things that enter your line of sight] [Evil Eye of Insanity（100）：Inflicts heresy attribute effect 「Insanity」 to things that enter your line of sight] [Evil Eye of Charm（100）：Inflicts heresy attribute effect 「Charm」 to things that enter your line of sight] [Evil Eye of Hypnosis（100）：Inflicts heresy attribute effect 「Hypnosis」 to things that enter your line of sight] [Evil Eye of Fear（100）：Inflicts heresy attribute effect 「Fear」 to things that enter your line of sight]</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>Uwa. It's really added. Such skills shouldn't have been in the list before. I mean, there are many kinds. I must choose one from this. I'm troubled.</p>
        <p>Information in charge. What is it, Body in charge? Why not acquire several of them? Eh, what do you mean? Did you know? I have eight eyes, you know? What's with it? In other words, can't I activate eight evil eyes at the same time? !? You, are you a genius!? Fufufu. Yes, I was a genius. Seriously? I see, I was a genius. If I'm a genius, then I will be forgiven even if I do anything! That's right. Isn't it amazing that eight evil eyes can be activated at the same time? Amazing. That's really amazing. Dream will spread. Because "Telephoto" is using one, there are seven left. When thinking that the normal view must be secured, there are six left. That's right. Choose one this time, and the remaining five will be acquired immediately after the skill points are accumulated, OK? OK OK. So, which evil eye do you think is good, Body in charge? I think that the attribute we don't have like curse or petrifaction is good. Heresy attribute is more antipersonnel rather than fighting against monster. Yeah. I would choose curse if it's me. We have experienced the petrifaction by the petrifaction lizard in the upper layer, and it's effect needs time. Though the power is high when it takes more time. After all, here, I would pick the safest one, curse. As expected from me. You understand it. Right?</p>
        <p>Thus, let's acquire "Evil Eye of Curse".</p>
        <p>[Curse：Weakens every ability, and deal damage to HP, MP, SP]</p>
