        <h2>028 - Eat eat eat</h2>
        <p>I eat earnestly in order to recover the stamina that became empty after evolving. First is the remaining part of the snake. The remainder of the snake which I had a hard time to finish eating it is now inside my stomach.</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Poison Resistance LV6] has become [Poison Resistance LV7]}</p>
        <p>The "Poison Resistance" skill leveled up right after I finish eating the snake. Thanks to this snake, my "Poison Resistance" went up by 2 levels. Delicious.</p>
        <p>Before I evolved, if I ate this much, my stomach would have bulged like a balloon but now, I wonder whether the food that I eat disappear in a different space or not because my stomach doesn't bulge. It's really like whatever I ate seems to disappear. On the contrary, the red total stamina gauge is recovering rapidly. Un. After coming to this world, I have encountered a lot of mysterious phenomenon but it seems that my current stomach is the most mysterious one. What's going on in my stomach? ( どうなってんだこれ？TL note: not sure about this)</p>
        <p>Well, there's no help for it even if I think deeply. I clearly get that this is that sort of world. Let's leave it to a scholar to clarify such a mysterious phenomenon.</p>
        <p>Therefore, my stomach didn't bulge even after I finish eating the snake. It didn't bulge so there's no way that it's sufficient. The red total stamina gauge is still far from full.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there's a mountain of monster's corpses in the home. There's the quantity that I was troubled with how to finish it before I evolved. As expected, with this much, my different dimension stomach will surely be satisfied.</p>
        <p>Thus, itadakimasu. Eat. Eat. Eat. I eat earnestly. Umu, I was a person with a small appetite in my previous life, but now, in this world, I am glutton. Now, I don't feel like I would lose to any food fighter! ( TL note: Food fighter = competitive eater)</p>
        <p>No, seriously, what's going on in my stomach? It's obvious that I'm eating something that's more than my body's volume and yet I can still eat more. Don't tell me that it's real that my stomach is connected with another dimension? Though I know that there's no help even if I think so, but I'm worried when it comes to my body. I won't understand anything even if I'm worried but I'm getting impatient. ( 気になっても答えがわからないのがこう、ムズムズするというかなんというか。TL note: not sure about this) Da! ( ダー！) Don't think! I shouldn't think about anything now and I should continue eating!</p>
        <p>Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat, ah, there's nothing to eat anymore. Hae? ( ハエ？) Did I ate all the food here? ....I ate them all. There's nothing left. Seriously. My stomach is in eight-tenth though. The red total stamina gauge is also the same. I don't become full even if I ate that much.</p>
        <p>Don't tell me from now on, it's always like this? It is just this time only right because I used up my energy for my evolution? Otherwise, I'm sure that I will starve to death. That is troubling. That is very troubling No right? There's no such thing right? If it is so then evolution is an outrageous land mine.</p>
        <p>No, when thinking properly, isn't it that evolution is relatively a land mine? I would lose consciousness and my energy becomes approximately empty. I don't know how long passed since I lost my consciousness and during that time, I would be defenseless. Though I don't had any problems because I'm inside the home, but for other monsters, isn't evolution quite life-threatening? I am really lucky.</p>
        <p>In addition, even if I succeed in the evolution, it's dangerous because I'll run out of energy. If they don't have any stored food like me, they would need to hunt in such a worn-out state. Won't it get defeated if it hunt in such state? I am really lucky. Is this the protagonist revision or opportunism? ( こういうのって、主人公補正とかご都合主義とかいうのかな？TL note: not sure too) Well, there's no way a spider can be a protagonist. Up until now, my spider life was not peaceful to the extent that I need to count on my good luck.</p>
        <p>I should start preparing when I'm around level 9 if the next evolution occurs at level 10. This time, I manage to evolve in a perfect state but normally, it won't go as well as this without any preparations. Ah, it was really good that I was able to kill that snake. If the snake was not there, I won't build the home and there won't be a mountain of food. Snake-sama, Thank you!</p>
        <p>Though it has recovered to some degree, my stomach is still not satisfied. Now that I have finished eating all the food, there's no reason to stay in this home anymore. Here's the start of the De-Hikki plan! Therefore, I leave this home that I'm indebted to and start my aimless journey again.</p>
        <p>Thank you, my second home. Unexpectedly, I have stayed for a long time even though it's just a temporary inn. Farewell!</p>
        <p>I depart triumphantly. For the time being, let's find a prey to fill my stomach. After that, well, I want to head towards the dungeon's exit even though I will wander aimlessly as usual.</p>
        <p>If there's a next evolution, I think that my body will grow bigger. My appearance didn't change after this evolution but it has such an effect. So it's not impossible that there's a pattern where I would become big immediately after evolution. Then, in this passage now, I'm a little uneasy with the size. If possible, I want to go to a bigger passage. I think the best choice is to go outside. It's possible that if I grow bigger inside the dungeon, I might not be able to get out if the exit is small. Indeed, living in this dungeon throughout my life is a bit too much.</p>
        <p>Un. Well, anyway, let's find a prey. The talk starts after that.</p>
