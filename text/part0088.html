        <h2>088 - Zoa Ere</h2>
        <p>Good morning. Though I don't know whether it's morning or not. I was able to wake up safely this time. Thank god. The evolution this time might have been the most dangerous one ever. It's good that I didn't ascend to heaven when I realized it.</p>
        <p>Eh? Not heaven, but hell? There's no way that I who's a girl of great rectitude will fall into the hell. Hahhahha.</p>
        <p>Well then, for the time being, I want to appraise my status as usual, but first of all, I must confirm the safety here. It doesn't seems that the eel shelter had any changes, but it's possible that I'm surrounded by monsters. Then, let's peep the outside quietly.</p>
        <p>Un. Nothing in particular. Yosh yosh. Then, while eating the eel, ah, I can't do that. Similar to the snake's case, I need to peel its scales off first in order to eat it. Shit. Well, fine. I don't feel hungry to the extent that I can't act, so is it because "Overeating" did its job? Let's confirm my status while peeling the scales off.</p>

        <p>Ha? Hmm? Wait wait. See it once again properly. My eyes might have rotted. I look at the numerical value of my status properly.</p>
        <p>Ha? Hae!? (　はえっ！？) E-Eeeeeeehhhh!?</p>
        <p>Wha, e-eeh? It increased greatly. It increased greatly!?</p>
        <p>This, seriously? Did it really increased this much? Oh. The combat ability is high was really true....</p>
        <p>Hey, is this really okay? Is it okay for me to be this strong? I will get carried away if I become this strong, you know? Is it okay? It's okay, right? .... Fu, fufufu. My heyday is here!</p>
        <p>The poor numerical value of my status up until now was settled instantly! Although it's low when it's compared with the eel, I have become strong to the extent that I won't die with just a poke from a small fry! Up until now, my state was "Receive attack = Death". But, with this, I have finally attain a pretty good status! Ku, kukuku. Kuhehehehehe.</p>
        <p>Skill level also rose considerably. Good good. What, "Taboo" rose!? Oi!? Level 5!? That means, another half to max!? This, if my expectation is correct, I think that something might happen when it becomes level 10. Crap. Well, there's still half. It's still safe, it should be.</p>
        <p>Next, there are new skills added. "Corrosion Attack", seriously? Corrosion is that corrosion, right? When I appraise it, it was that corrosion that's more dangerous than my expectations, right? Can I use that?. I'm so amazing.</p>
        <p>The another new skill is "Silent". Although I can expect its effect somehow, let's appraise it just in case.</p>
        <p>[Silent：Generation of sound is suppressed]</p>
        <p>Un. As expected. I did it! My ninja level increased! My ambush can only be used once from now on, I wonder?</p>
        <p>And, I'm very interested in a skill. "Spider Thread" and "Severing Thread" disappeared, and the "Universal Thread" skill is newly added. Perhaps, it's the "Spider Thread" evolution, but where did "Severing Thread" go?</p>
        <p>[Universal Thread：Customizable thread is created. Customize field：Viscosity, Elasticity, Resilience, Texture, Strength, Size, Attribute Endowment 「Slash」「Blow」「Shock」 etc, Resistance Endowment]</p>
        <p>The attribute endowment is added in it. Apparently, "Slash" has the same effect as "Severing Thread", "Blow" is blow attribute, and "Shock" is shock attribute can be endowed to my thread. "Blow" is like striking. The "Shock" seems to make my thread to generate shock wave for a moment. If someone touches the thread in that state, the person will receive damage from the shock. This will be extremely useful if it's not the middle layer! Kuu, I want to get out from the middle layer and use it!</p>
        <p>When I was confirming my status, the scale peeling finished. Yosh, then, let's taste the eel. Itadakimasu.</p>
        <p>... Delicious. A different flavor from the catfish. I'll say it again. Delicious.</p>
        <p>My SP was not exhausted in this evolution. My stockpile of "Overeating" decreased completely instead. It's the evidence that "Overeating" did a good job. If that's the case, then I don't need to save up food at each evolution because I can just stockpile it in "Overeating". Therefore, I will eat a lot, and increase my stockpile. If I count backwards from the previous numerical value, it's possible to stockpile up to about skill level&times;100, so it's possible to stockpile up to about 800 now.</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Overeating LV8] has become [Overeating LV9]}</p>
        <p>Level up came as soon as I said it. With this, the amount that can be stockpiled has increased even more.</p>
