        <h2>100 - Oh? Appraisal-sama's state....?</h2>
        <p>I wander around the middle layer today. Umu. Although quite a long time passed since I reached the middle layer,  I still can't see the end. As expected from the world's largest labyrinth. If a man tries to capture this, isn't it that this is a level where the man have to be resolved to devote his life?</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Appraisal LV9] has become [Appraisal LV10]}</p>
        <p>Oh? Ooh? Oooh!?</p>
        <p>Finally. Finally, Appraisal-sama reach max level! Uwa, I'm very happy! The first one that I acquired, the Appraisal-sama that shared joys and sorrows has finally became a perfect form!</p>
        <p>The "Appraisal" that was useless in the beginning. A strange element is added whenever its level rises. The joy that the usability gradually improves. Appraisal-san who grew up and became splendid. Although you were complained all the time, you grew up with effort. And, to become the Appraisal-sama that everyone recognize. Such you also have finally, finally! Uoon! Finally. You have done well. I'm impressed! Thank you, Appraisal-sama! Please take care of me from now on, Appraisal-sama!</p>
        <p>But, there's no evolution or derivation. No, it's fine. It's a great thing even if only Appraisal-sama reached max level. Though I expected something like an evolution to a person who rules wisdom. There's nothing. I thought that there is if it's Appraisal-sama, but there's nothing. It's a shock. ... Really nothing?</p>
        <p>{Za,...... Zaa,...Za, Zaa, Zaa,......}</p>
        <p>... What's this sound that's similar to the television's sandstorm?</p>
        <p>{Zaa, Request, Zaa, ... lack of High Rank Administrator authority. Zaa, .......}</p>
        <p>Eh? What?</p>
        <p>{Zaa, ... nager sari.........Zaa, ... Rejection, Zaa}</p>
        <p>Somehow, it's dangerous. Although I don't know what's dangerous, it's dangerous.</p>
        <p>{Zaa, Pin!}</p>
        <p>My body shook unintentionally when I heard the clear "Pin" sound.</p>
        <p>{High Rank Administrator D accepted the request}<br/>{Skill [Wisdom] is being constructed}<br/>{Construction completed}</p>
        <p>{Conditions met. Skill [Wisdom] was acquired}<br/>{[Appraisal LV10] has unified with [Wisdom]}<br/>{[Detection LV10] has unified with [Wisdom]}</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Taboo LV7] has become [Taboo LV8]}</p>
        <p>{Conditions met. Title [Ruler of Wisdom] was acquired}<br/>{By the effects of the title [Ruler of Wisdom], skill [Magic Extremity][Divine Magic] was acquired}<br/>{[MP Recovery Speed LV4] has unified with [Magic Extremity]}<br/>{[MP Consumption Down LV4] has unified with [Magic Extremity]}<br/>{[Magic Amount LV9] has unified with [Divine Magic]} (星魔 ) {[Protection LV4] has unified with [Divine Magic]}</p>
        <p>Ha? Huh? Haaaaaaaa?</p>
        <p>No no. Strange. This is indeed strange in various ways. What happen? Why did it become like this? What should I do?</p>
        <p>Let's calm down. Body in charge, first of all, take a deep breath.</p>
        <p>Hi, hi, fuu.</p>
        <p>Yosh. Let's arrange it in turns. First of all, it begun when I heard that sound. What's that? I don't know. Although I will usually cast away things that I don't understand all the time, this time only won't that way. After all, this is a clearly abnormal situation.</p>
        <p>Abnormal, yes, it's abnormal. Although I have acquired skills with recognition that this is such a world up until now, skills doesn't exist in Japan. It's more abnormal if there's skill in Japan. Such natural thing and this world is such a world, so is it okay to accept such a simple thought?</p>
        <p>It was okay if it's a while ago. But, now is different. I certainly heard that the voice of heaven said like this.</p>
        <p>{High Rank Administrator D accepted the request}<br/>{Skill [Wisdom] is being constructed}<br/>{Construction completed}</p>
        <p>This words,<i>it's just like someone is watching me and that person made a skill according to my grumble</i>.</p>
        <p>If it's really like that, then the criminal is the person called Administrator D. And, when I think about the word "high rank", this existence called Administrator cannot be only be D.</p>
        <p>Then, what does this Administrator manage? It's decided. Skills. If I think by this flow, that's the only that I can think. In short,<i>the skills in this world are given by those guys called Administrator</i>.</p>
        <p>What is it for? How? As expected, I don't know that. Although I don't know, I can only say this.</p>
        <p>Something is strange in this world.</p>
        <p>A cold thing runs on my back. It's different from the time when I encounter the Earth Dragon and my Mother, it's an another kind of fear that invades me slowly.</p>
        <p>The Administrator, are they chuckling when they see my panicking figure now? Scary. The skills that I have relied on up until now has become something that's hard to be understand. What should I do after this? What should I do?</p>
