        <h2>049 - Appraisal-san, you were a cheat after all</h2>
        <p>I move along the wall stealthily. After eating the three monsters, the red stamina gauge didn't decrease again. Un? I was certain that the amount is large because it almost recovered to max after eating one of them. But.... The probable cause, is it the "Overeating" skill? Did it stock the excess food? If I'm not mistaken, this phenomenon occurred after acquiring the "Overeating" skill. When thinking so, it doesn't seem to be irrelevant.</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Appraisal LV6] has become [Appraisal LV7]}</p>
        <p>Oh? Ooh? Oooh!? "Appraisal" has arrived! Appraisal-san has arrived! (TL note: the word "has arrived" is from this キタ.) With this, I'll win!</p>
        <p>When I think about the last progress, can I expect more from you? Is it okay? I won't forgive you if it's something disappointing, you know? Can you jump over the hurdle that I have raised even further properly? You must not go under it, okay? Well now, how's the appraisal result!?</p>

        <p>Eh? Seriously? Really? Not a mistake in vision? Oh, ooh, oooh, uooooooo!? Skills have arrived! Seriously, Appraisal-san, good job! You really cross over the raised hurdle! Yahoo! My heyday came!</p>
        <p>Appraisal-san, you're seriously incredible. Thank you. Seriously, thank you! With this, I can finally double appraise the skills with unknown effects! Which, one, should, I, pick, first?</p>
        <p>Let's start from the "Overeating" that I have thought about a while ago.</p>
        <p>[Overeating：It becomes possible to take meals exceeding the limit. And the excess part will be stock as a surplus. However, weight is gained accordingly. The amount that can be stocked increases by level]</p>
        <p>O-oh. Hohou. It's almost as expected. In other words, it's a skill that the stamina won't decrease as much as I eat excessively. However, I will gain weight. Am I that fat? I don't know such feeling. Is this because that I'm a spider that it won't stand out? If it's a human, this might be a huge demerit.</p>
        <p>Next, I will pick this.</p>
        <p>[Powerful：Increases Average Offensive Ability equivalent to the skill level] (TL note: I tried my best to translate it to be easy to understand. Hope you can understand. If you have a better one just suggest it. I will change it right away)</p>
        <p>Hee. I see. In other words, this is just a simple status strengthening skill. Ah, which reminds me, this skill level rose after I leveled up. I surely thought that my offensive ability increased by 2 through level up, but it looks like one of the point is from this skill. That means.</p>
        <p>[Sturdy：Increases Average Defensive Ability equivalent to the skill level]</p>
        <p>As expected, this skill is the defensive ability version of "Powerful". Fumu, although the effect is low, judging from my rubbish status, I'm grateful that it can rise even if it's a little.</p>
        <p>Let's continue steadily! The next one, first time seeing it. Because it's level 2, its level should have risen somewhere. Did I miss the voice of heaven?</p>
        <p>[Idaten：A bonus of skill level×100 is added to the Average Speed Ability. And, a growth correction of skill level×10 is added when level up]</p>
        <p>Ha? Ah, eh, ha? Ah, it's thank to this skill that my speed is abnormally fast. I see I see. Haiiiiiiiiiii!?</p>
        <p>Eh, what's with this outrageous skill? I surely thought that my speed is fast because of my species, but it's because of this? Oou. "Idaten", don't tell me that this is the rumored reincarnation privilege? Oh! Seriously!?</p>
        <p>Being born as a rare skill holder, reincarnation privilege is delicious! I wasn't called as the "Idaten" in the game for show! Uhyaa! (　うひゃー！) The tension increased!</p>
        <p>Then, what about this skill?</p>
        <p>[n％I＝W：Impossible to appraise]</p>
        <p>Hmm? Impossible to appraise? Why? Err. After coming this far, an unexpected fumble. Well, judging from the name, it looks like it's bugged. Although it makes me feel slightly unpleasant, there's no help for it if I can't appraise it. I hope that it's not a negative skill.</p>
        <p>I pull myself together and appraise the next one.</p>
        <p>[Taboo：A skill that is acquired by the person who violated a taboo. You must not raise it]</p>
        <p>Uwa. This time, it's saying something unbelievable to confuse me. But, these words, no matter how I think, it's definitely a curse or a negative effect. Uwa, I don't need it. Even if you say that I must not raise it, it's already level 2 before I know. Seriously. My increased tension fell down at a stretch.</p>
