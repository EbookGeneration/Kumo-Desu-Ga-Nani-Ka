        <h2>047 - Poison poison</h2>
        <p>Today, I'm moving stealthily again. Although the labyrinth zone in the upper layer has a lot of forked road, this passage is a straight road all this time. It's good that I won't get lost, but if this passage leads to the bottom layer, will I be able to return? Ah, let's put away the unpleasant imagination. It surely leads to the middle layer! Let's believe so!</p>
        <p>Well then, the red gauge will decrease soon. Though I ate the snail insect last time, I want to make it as the last resort. Although there are several of them moving slowly on the wall, I don't think I want to eat it willingly. With that taste, other monsters won't be eager to eat it.</p>
        <p>That's why, I want to find a normal meal somehow while the gauge still have time. Let's put away whether the monsters with poison are normal or not. Well, I have eaten a lot of monsters with poison. It's that guy now. I didn't think that I want to eat something delicious. ...I miss the cup noodles.</p>
        <p>Now then, front, all clear! Rear, all clear! No dangers around! Yosh yosh.</p>
        <p>[Elro Randanel　LV8　Failed to appraise its status] [Elro Randanel　LV7　Failed to appraise its status] [Elro Randanel　LV7　Failed to appraise its status]</p>
        <p>It's the three intimate friend monsters that appeared before my eyes. These guys really comes in 3 anywhere and anytime. However, should I say it's as expected from the lower layer, their level is quite high. If I assume that evolution occurs at level 10, then, that level 8 guy might be able to evolve soon. Well, such future will never come.</p>
        <p>I go around to their rear stealthily. And here, the appearance of the new weapon, Cast Net! Eh, it's just as its name? Who cares. It's not like I can think of an exquisite name every time. Even though I grinned when I thought of the Kumorning Star. I would be troubled if that quality is demanded every time.</p>
        <p>Therefore, Cast Net, go!</p>
        <p>Don't think that it's just a mere cast net. This new weapon, un, it's a little lonely without a name, ah, explanation? Yeah, yeah. This guy, even though it becomes a lump immediately after throwing it, the moment it reaches the target, a cobweb spreads and wraps it's target! This is made delicately with the dream combo of the "Spider Thread" and "Thread Manipulation".</p>
        <p>The three monsters are wrapped in the net without being able to do anything. Hahaha. Big catch, big catch! Now, I just need to kill them with my "Poison Fang" as usual. Hai, chomp!</p>
        <p>{Conditions met. Title [Poison Technique User] was acquired}<br/>{By the effects of the title [Poison Technique User], skill [Poison Synthesis LV1][Poison Magic LV1] was acquired}</p>
        <p>Oh? Ooh? I get a title! Is it poison? It is poison! No, finally, after I have been using poison all this time since I was born. Isn't it hard to acquire this title? I mean, the titles I have acquired up until now, all of the conditions are considerably strict. Is the title that difficult to acquire? Well, I acquired it so it's fine.</p>
        <p>And the skills are "Poison Synthesis" and "Poison Magic". The "Poison Magic"  is as usual, I don't know how to use it, so I'm leaving it as it is. My magic increased again. As for the "Poison Synthesis", I don't know what kind of effect it has. "Poison Synthesis", does it mean I can make poison? However, because I'm a spider, poison is made involuntarily.</p>
        <p>Nono. For the time being, let's postpone the verification of the skills. First of all, I must kill the remaining two quickly. Therefore, I bite them with "Poison Fang".</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Poison Fang LV7] has become [Poison Fang LV8]}</p>
        <p>Oh? Ooh? Oooh? Is today the poison day? Good good. If I assume that level 10 is the highest, isn't level 8 a considerably deadly poison? It was quite effective against the bee that should have poison in it. This one is more pleasant than acquiring the title.</p>
        <p>Yosh. I carry the dead three monsters to the shade of a rock.  Ugu, with my weak status, carrying 3 at once is tough. It might be better if I carry it one by one. Huh? Didn't I do the same thing previously? At that time, didn't I regret that I should have carry it one by one? Hmm? I don't remember! I don't remember such past! It's not that my memory is bad! There's no such past! Okay!? Yosh.</p>
        <p>For the time being, let's try "Poison Synthesis" while eating. Even if I say so, I don't know how to use it, so I should just try pray silently. Thus, I whisper and pray silently, "Poison Synthesis"!</p>
        <p>Something appear when I pray silently. It's the feeling that an image is displayed in the head like the "Appraisal".</p>
        <p>[Poison Synthesis Menu] [Weak Poison] [Spider Poison LV8]</p>
        <p>What's this? Ah, but it's displayed in this way, so "Appraisal" should work.</p>
        <p>[Poison Synthesis Menu：Poison can be synthesized] [Weak Poison：Very weak poison] [Spider Poison LV8：Lethal poison secreted by the spider. LV8 is very powerful]</p>
        <p>Fumu. "Spider Poison" is my original poison. And, perhaps, the "Poison Synthesis" level 1 can only make weak poison. I select weak poison for trial. A ball of water rose in front of me and it drops to the ground and forms a puddle. Oops. Is this the pattern where there must be a container? I appraise the puddle just in case.</p>
        <p>[Puddle of Weak Poison]</p>
        <p>Un. It seems to be weak poison. I see. In other words, this "Poison Synthesis" skill can create poison without any material. Although it seems convenient for a human, I'm a spider. It might be useful depending on how I use it. Un. Producing poison with no cost is surely great.</p>
        <p>Ah, no, wait a minute? My MP has decrease. It's not for free. Ah, the doubtful degree increased at a stretch. Although the poison that can be synthesize might increase when a level rises, I can already make powerful poison that is called the "Spider Poison". I don't feel the charm from it. But, it's good that there's use to it. It's entirely better than the annihilation of magic-related skills.</p>
