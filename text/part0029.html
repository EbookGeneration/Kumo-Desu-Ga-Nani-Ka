        <h2>029 - The things that I need to do is still the same even if I evolve</h2>
        <p>Found the 1st prey.</p>
        <p>[Elro Frog　LV5　Failed to appraise its status]</p>
        <p>The frog that I'm familiar with. But it looks like it has the highest level among the guys I have seen before.</p>
        <p>Un. I feel like wanting to know how much have changed in my abilities after evolving? I think I should have become stronger because it's called as evolution.</p>
        <p>But. My level also falls to level 1. It's good if the revision is as much as the level I have raised but it's dangerous if level 1 decrease my stats considerably. ( 今まで上げた分のレベル補正がそのままならいいんだけど、もしレベル1相当に減ってるんだとしたら危ないよねー。TL note: not sure about this) Well, there's probably no such thing here but there's such a system according to the game.  It's temporary weakening and I would become much more stronger than before if I raise it once again. Though it's not wrong in a speedrun game, but it's a matter of life and death if it's forced to be done in reality. (TL note: やりこみ not sure on this one. It has the meaning of speedrun in it)</p>
        <p>Un. I think that it's probably all right, but let's go with the safety measures here. I should not do anything reckless if I'm uneasy. My life hangs on this so I need to proceed carefully.</p>
        <p>I climb the wall stealthily. I head towards the ceiling and advance upside down. I fix my body using a thread once I arrive right above the frog. I also release threads to make a small web on my forelegs. Preparations completed. I hang down a thread towards the frog and I move down on the thread.</p>
        <p>3, 2, 1, Go!</p>
        <p>I assault it from the overhead to cover the frog with the web which I held in my forelegs. The frog was caught in the web without an interval to avoid it and I who hangs on the frog with a web, shoots additional threads on the frog's body. Once it becomes impossible for the frog to move, I approach it and bite it!</p>
        <p>Umu. It's a skillful hunting even if I say so myself. ( 我ながら鮮やかな狩りですな。TL note: not sure about this) Maybe it's time to called myself as an Assassin. Kukuku. Don't think you can escape from this thread and fangs.</p>
        <p>Ah, for the time being, let's eat the frog. Itadakimasu.</p>
        <p>However, it's that. The things I need to do is still the same even if I evolve. At first, my objective was to gain combat experience but I feel like that the objective is getting hazy. After all, the monsters around here generally has a higher rank than me. My life won't be sufficient no matter how many lives I have if I fought it directly. Why there's no one that is in a reasonable level to fight with? ( もう少し適正レベルってやつを考えちゃくれませんかねー。TL note: Totally not sure with this) Though the surprise attack from my assassination combo works well. But after I make my nest, I don't have the opportunity to launch a surprise attack. Then I feel that my first aim is out of the track because I was suppose to get stronger to be able to fight against those who breakthrough my nest.</p>
        <p>......Nono! I have evolved! My level rose! It would be advantageous if I raise my basic abilities! Up until now, my actions is not pointless! Let's put it that way!</p>
        <p>Fuu. My activity in this area has become nearly meaningless. Dangerous, dangerous.</p>
        <p>Umumu. However, the real problem, keep relying on a surprise attack is kinda dangerous. One of the reasons I lost my home is because I was overestimating my home's power. And here, I want to develop something into a weapon. I won't have so much troubles if I can think immediately.</p>
        <p>The one that I come up with right away was none other than the unknown effect "Heresy Magic". If I can use this then I might be able develop new strategies but I just don't know how to to use it. Gununu. ( ぐぬぬ。)</p>
        <p>If I were a human, will I be taught on how to use it? Well, there's no help for it even if I make such an assumption. But being forced to solve everything on my own is both comfortable and troublesome. It's comfortable that I don't need to associate pointlessly with other people but it's also troublesome that I need to confront such a hopeless thing. Either way, in this figure, I don't think it's possible for me to interact with humans. I can't talk.</p>
        <p>If there's telepathy, then it might be possible right? Come to think of it, I have reached level 10, so isn't it time to use my skill points? My skill points should become 100 points if I assume that I gain 10 skill points in each level. I was able to acquire "Appraisal" with 100 points, so I might acquire a new skill soon.</p>
        <p>Therefore, voice of heaven-san, can I acquire a skill?</p>
        <p>《Currently you have 200 skill points. 　The skill [Telepathy LV1] can be acquired by spending 100 skill point. Do you want to acquire it?》</p>
        <p>Oou. It's really possible to acquire it....</p>
        <p>Hmm. Telepathy doesn't have its use in the present condition. This is rejected.</p>
        <p>But I have saved up 200 points. That means, 20 points gained per level. Ah, then I should be able to acquire a new skill when I became level 6. Because there's the "Appraisal" too that is useless after acquiring it but if I raise it's level steadily, it might be usable in the future. I might have did something wasteful.</p>
        <p>Hmm? No, wait, wait. Let's recall my memories properly. If I'm not mistaken, didn't I tried to acquire a skill when I was level 6 but it end up that I can't acquire it? ( TL note: From chapter 14. But she was level 5 that time) Huh? Didn't it said that I'm lacking of skill points? Hmmm?</p>
        <p>The reasons that I can think of are the points gained increase by the height of the level and increase by evolution. Though both are possible, I have no way to verify it now. For the time being, I will put away the reason why the point increase.</p>
