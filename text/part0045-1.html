    <h2>045.1 - Status</h2>
    <p />
    <p>When I pass through the door, the big venue catches my eyes. A red carpet extends straight from the door and ahead of it, there's a pedestal and a man waiting behind it. A large number of people close to the wall, look at the state here quietly. Everyone who attend this ceremony are all senior nobles.</p>
    <p>Sue and I walk silently on the carpet. I have received lectures for this day to walk majestically. Although the gaze of the nobles pierce me, I try to not be conscious on it as much as possible.</p>
    <p>Before long, I arrived before the pedestal. Sue and I stop there and get down on our knees. The man who waited behind the pedestal is the present king who is our father, Magus Delua Anareich.</p>
    <p>"From here, I will hold the appraisal ceremony"</p>
    <p>The voice of the king full of dignity sounds in the hall. Although I say that he's my father, I have only met him a few times. Therefore, rather than blood relatives, the feeling of a relative who's a great person is stronger. Because of that, the tension is overwhelming. Even now the king continues to talk, but it doesn't enters my head.</p>
    <p>"Then, Shurein Zagan Anareich. Stand" "Yes"</p>
    <p>I stand up according to the king's call.</p>
    <p>"Start the appraisal"</p>
    <p>I move forward several steps and get on the stool placed in front of the pedestal. If there's no stool, I won't be able to reach the pedestal at my current height. A black stone was inserted in the pedestal. The stone is the appraisal stone, but it's smaller than I thought. It's the size that can fit into the palm of an adult. I put my hands on the appraisal stone while thinking unexpectedly. As I was lectured beforehand, I try to have appraisal in my mind. It succeeded easily and my status was displayed.</p>

    <p>I can see the status. At the same time, the appraisal result of the status was displayed in the screen-like thing attached to the wall in front. The screen is connected to the appraisal stone, thus, the appraisal result can be displayed in the big screen. This world doesn't seem to have the concept of personal information.</p>
    <p>A commotion occurs. The king speaks to pacifies it, but the commotion didn't settled. My status must be really out of the standard. Still, it was just as I expected.</p>
    <p>My magic-related ability value is considerably high. Anna can vouch for it. Compared with the physical ability that is appropriate as my age. No, it seems to be considerably higher than others in the same age, but it's not out of the standard like magic. So, it became such an unbalance status.</p>
    <p>As for the skills, I roughly know that there's a voice called Divine Words (神言) that will inform you whenever a level rose or a skill is acquired. However, I have two unknown skills. "Divine Protection of Heaven" and the last unknown skill that looks like a garbled text. I'm interested about the two skills and I appraise it.</p>
    <p>[Divine Protection of Heaven：Protected by the divine protection of heaven. It becomes easier to obtain the desired result in every situation]<br />[n％I＝W：Impossible to appraise]</p>
    <p>What's this? The "Divine Protection of Heaven" is terrific. A skill that can be called as a cheat. However, it says that it becomes easier to obtain it, so it won't be as I desire always. Although it's a great skill, overconfidence is a taboo.</p>
    <p>The unknown one is the other skill. If the name is incomprehensible, the appraisal result is also incomprehensible. I don't know what kind of skill it is at all. It's also incomprehensible that this is the result from the best appraisal stone. If this can't appraise it, then it's impossible to check the details of this skill. Really incomprehensible.</p>
    <p>"That, is it the same as the Duke's daughter?" "Ah, that genius" "However, His Highness is the same as the Duke's daughter, no, he has the talent more than that"</p>
    <p>Just now, in the commotion, the word Duke's daughter can be heard here and there. Is there a guy besides me who have the same status as me? I don't think that there's such a guy other than Sue.....</p>
    <p>"Quiet!"</p>
    <p>To the shout of the king, the hall becomes quiet. The king presents me a sheet of paper. This paper is a magic tool connected to the appraisal stone and the appraisal result will be written on the paper with printing magic tool. I receive it respectfully. And, I bowed and withdrew behind. With this, my appraisal is complete.</p>
    <p>Next is Sue's turn. It goes without saying that the hall become noisy again because Sue has almost the same result with me. However, unlike me, Sue didn't have the "Divine Protection of Heaven" and the mysterious garbled text skill.</p>
