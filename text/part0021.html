        <h2>021 - HP MP SP</h2>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Appraisal LV3] has became [Appraisal LV4]}</p>
        <p>Oh, finally my "Appraisal" leveled up. Recently, I didn't feel sick from overflowing information. Everything's going well. Well, let's see what has been added to it?</p>
        <p>[Small Lesser Taratect　LV6　No name]</p>
        <p>Huh? No change? Just when I was thinking about it, there were some lines with color under the species name. What's this?</p>
        <p>[HP Bar]</p>
        <p>I appraised the green line unintentionally. As a result, I know what the line means. HP, an abbreviation often used in games. In short, when you run out of HP, you would get a game over. A health gauge. The gauge appeared in the appraisal result.</p>
        <p>I am simply glad. Up until now, I can only know how many damage I had received through my sense only. From now on, I can understand my current condition just by looking at the bar.</p>
        <p>Now, my HP gauge is approximately full. It looks like it decreased a little and on the right end of the line, there are some bar color in black. Umu. Though I want it to be in numerical form but I should appreciate what I have now.</p>
        <p>And there are three different bars under the HP bar. First of all, let's appraise the blue one under the HP bar.</p>
        <p>[MP Bar]</p>
        <p>Well, it's as expected. If there's HP then there's definitely MP. I think it should be showing the amount of my remaining magic power. Even if I say that, I can't use magic so it's unrelated to me. It will probably decrease when I use magic. Of course, my MP doesn't decrease because I don't use magic.</p>
        <p>There are two bars under the MP bar which is a mystery to me. It's a yellow and red bar. But the two of them sticks together and become a thick bar. I don't know what this bar shows. Appraisal.</p>
        <p>[SP Bar]</p>
        <p>Hmm? SP? Skill point? Hmmm? Is it necessary to make it as a bar? No, wait. Maybe this is not skill point? Since SP is abbreviated, I don't know which abbreviation is it. Yosh, I should appraise SP.</p>
        <p>[SP： Stamina Point]</p>
        <p>Oh? Ah, as expected, it was not skill point and it was the abbreviation of a different word. It's confusing!</p>
        <p>Fuu. Stamina. A physical version of magic power. Does it decrease if I move? Mmm, hmm? But why there are two gauges? Moreover, the upper yellow gauge is full while the red gauge has decrease around one-third. What are the difference of these two? For trial, I appraise the stamina point again.</p>
        <p>[Stamina Point：Point consumed by movement]</p>
        <p>Ah, un. After all, I don't understand it. Ah, but won't I understand it soon if I observe it? If possible, I want to appraise myself continuously because I want to look at my HP constantly. I try to maintain the appraisal cast on myself. Hmm, is it like this? Un. It looks like it went well. Now, I can always confirm my HP unless I cancel my "Appraisal" on purpose. It became quite convenient.</p>
        <p>Though it's convenient being able to see my own HP, but won't it be advantageous if I can see my opponent's HP? By looking at the opponent's HP, I can know how many hits to defeat it and if my opponent is a magic user, it's natural to win if I knew it's MP. Well, I still haven't meet any monster that can use magic. But, able to know a part of the opponent's information serves as a huge advantage in a fight. Did the "Appraisal" skill finally raised the cheat skill flag? Fufufu. I intentionally acquired the useless "Appraisal" skill because I had anticipate that this would happen. It's not that I never knew that it's useless! Let's pretend that it's like that!</p>
        <p>Well, let's pull my self together and explore the dungeon. Oh, a monster.</p>
        <p>[Elro Ferect　LV2　Failed to appraise its status]</p>
        <p>I withdraw my previous remarks. It's still useless. Why does it have to fail in such a crucial place.... Haa, I'm a fool to expect from it.</p>
        <p>For the time being, I should do something with the centipede. Hmm. But isn't it impossible to launch a surprise attack here? Although, it haven't noticed me yet but it's heading towards my direction.</p>
        <p>Ah, I got a good idea!</p>
        <p>I crawl up the wall stealthily. The body of a spider is convenient for such time. Without change, I arrive at the ceiling. Ugh, it's slightly hard to cling on the ceiling upside down. But I can hold on if I brace myself.</p>
        <p>I move along the ceiling stealthily. Hold on, my leg! Hmm? My stamina gauge is decreasing? Now's not the time for it. I need to concentrate on my strategy.</p>
        <p>I arrive right above of the centipede. Yosh yosh. That guy haven't notice me who's right above of it. I attach a thread to the ceiling and descend quietly towards the centipede.</p>
        <p>And then I jump at it! The centipede starts to panic but it's already too late. I wrapped it with my thread. And bite it! Fuhahaha! This is my so called "Be careful, I'm coming from the top" strategy! A great success!</p>
        <p>Well then, itadakimasu.</p>
        <p>Fumu. I recall about the stamina gauge while eating. When I was clinging on the ceiling, it was the yellow gauge that decreased. I decreased slowly when I straddle my leg. But now, it's fully recovered. Hmm?</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Acquired skill [Paralysis Resistance LV1]}</p>
        <p>O, Oh! Centipede, I didn't know that you have paralysis in your body! Won't it be dangerous if I failed to defeat it with my surprise attack? Let's be careful next time.</p>
        <p>Hmm? Hmmm? Somehow the red line of the stamina gauge is recovering a little. Thought it should have decreased by around one-third, it's recovering slowly and now, it's around a quarter from full. Why? Did I do anything that can recover my stamina?</p>
        <p>....Ah, I ate my meal. Ah! So it's like that! I see. I understood it a little.</p>
        <p>In other words, the lower red gauge shows the current whole physical strength. And the upper yellow gauge decreases when stamina is used instantaneously.</p>
        <p>For trial, I try to run at full speed. The yellow gauge decrease instantly. I ran out of energy at the same time as the yellow gauge was exhausted.</p>
        <p>Zeze. (ゼーゼー) (Gasping sound) Ah, running at full speed after eating. I'm such an idiot. My stomach is aching. This is intense.</p>
        <p>However, with this, it's confirmed. The yellow gauge is the gauge of instantaneous power. I would lose my breath when it's exhausted. However, because it's consumed instantaneously, the recovery is fast. In fact, once my panting stops, the gauge recovers steadily.</p>
        <p>And the lower red gauge is my total physical strength. The red gauge decreased a little when I ran. It seems dangerous if the red gauge is fully exhausted. Like I cannot move if it's exhausted. I don't want to be in such situation.</p>
        <p>It would recover if meals or nourishments are supplied and I should always pay attention to the remaining amount of the red gauge.</p>
