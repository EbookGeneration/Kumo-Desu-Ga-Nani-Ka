        <h2>068 - The end of the lower layer</h2>
        <p>After giving up on making "Detection" usable, I tried the combo of "Spider Thread" and "Poison Attack". The result was, gufufufufu. Ah, I look forward to test it in a combat. Uhehe.</p>
        <p>After that, I continued walking all the time. I didn't encounter any monsters during the time. It was very peaceful. My stamina doesn't decrease because I ate too much, and it looks like there won't be any problems even if I don't hunt a monster for a while. That's why, now is the chance to advance further since there are no monsters.</p>
        <p>Because I'm free when I'm walking, I raised skills that seems to be able to raised while walking. As a result, the five sense type skills, "Enhanced Vision", "Enhanced Hearing", "Enhanced Smell" and "Enhanced Touch" rose to level 5. When doing so, "Concentration" rose secondarily, and it became level 8 now. Although the "Concentration" skill rises considerably fast before, the level up became faster by the effect of "Pride". This skill, although there's no actual feeling in its effect, it's a considerably effective skill. It's also thanks to this that I can still concentrate on fighting even in such extreme state during the monkey battle. It's a plain skill but the degree of contribution is fairly high.</p>
        <p>And, as for the five senses type, as expected, the difference becomes clear when the skills become level 5. The view that I can see originally became clearer. I can even see the surface of the rock far ahead if I intend to see it. It's the same for the sense of hearing and smell. All the sounds and smells in the labyrinth have been understood.</p>
        <p>However, "Enhanced Touch" can be said that it has the advantage and disadvantage. I became too sensitive. Ah, I don't mean the erotic one. Don't expect it. Those fools who expect it will receive a punishment of being coiled by my threads and I will make you ascend to heaven with my poison fang. But still, for those who are 「It's a reward in our industry」, as expected, I will run away.</p>
        <p>Ah, the story about "Enhanced Touch". To be specific, I can't calm down because I can sense the flow of the air. I got used to it a little after a while, but originally, it should be raised slowly and gradually accustom to it. Because the level was raised rapidly, the sense of discomfort is horrible. It seems to take a little time until I'm completely used to it.</p>
        <p>Well, when it becomes impossible to endure anymore, it's possible to switch it off, so I think I will do that. When you say which one, the sense of smell has a lot of chance to switch it off. I don't think that I want to smell something smelly willingly.</p>
        <p>When thinking so, I feel that there's no point acquiring the "Enhanced Taste". After all, the monsters in this labyrinth taste bad. I have not met a delicious monster before. Among them, there's this snail insect that must not be eaten.</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, I haven't seen a snail insect since a little while ago. It's was all over the place before I received the monkeys' attack. Now, there's not even one anywhere. Where did it go?</p>
        <p>Ah, even so, it's hot. I want an air-conditioner. What kind of treatment is this that I, who enters the half Hikki state when I'm in a room where the air-conditioner works during summer, to move in this heat. The frail me is weak in hot and cold.</p>
        <p>... Hot? Wait a minute, hot? The labyrinth that the upper layer and the lower layer are always at a comfortable temperature is hot?</p>
        <p>I look around the surroundings slowly. There's no appearance of a monster in the vicinity. I also don't sense any special dangers. And yet, my body feels the changes in the environment.</p>
        <p>I look ahead along the wall. Although it's hard to notice, the slope is rising upwards.</p>
        <p>Up. Up! It's going up! Uwa, I did it! Finally, it finally came! Going upwards means that, right? It should be that!</p>
        <p>It means I'm ascending from the lower layer to the middle layer!</p>
        <p>Hyahhoi! I did it! This path was the right one! With this, I can finally escape from the nightmarish lower layer! I don't have to be scared of the Earth Dragon anymore! I won't be attacked by a large troop of monkeys anymore! I don't need to hide myself earnestly and escape stealthily while being nervous about the monsters around!</p>
        <p>I began to run instinctively. As expected from the speed specialization. I run up the slope at the speed that even I'm surprised. But, my yellow stamina gauge won't last.</p>
        <p>Zee, zee.</p>
        <p>Ah. Even if I have the speed, I won't last long if I don't have instantaneous force. This was a blind spot. When the time comes, I can use my red stamina gauge to continue running like what I did when I ran from the centipedes, but I should put this in my head as one of my weakness.</p>
        <p>Leaving that aside, I will finish climbing up the slope soon. If I finish climbing this slope, I can finally see the middle layer that I have only seen it in my dreams.</p>
        <p>It was a long way to here. The beginning was when I was chased by a snake, and I messed up and fell into the lower layer. From there, it was dangers in rapid succession. I was nearly killed by the bees, I was nearly killed by the Earth Dragon, I escape from the den of the powerful monsters, I was nearly killed by the taste of the snail insect and I was also nearly killed by the monkeys. There's nothing but nearly killed. I have survived well. Isn't it eventful? I think that there won't be a punishment even if there's even a little good thing to happen.</p>
        <p>But, with this, it's time to say goodbye to such a life where I'm living side-by-side with death!</p>
        <p>Goodbye, lower layer! Hello, middle layer!</p>
        <p>Beyond the slope was a scorching earth where magma spreads all over.</p>
