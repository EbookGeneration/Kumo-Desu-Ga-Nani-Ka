        <h2>085 - Spider vs Fire Drake End</h2>
        <p>The eel wriggle its long body. In the offense and defense so far, the eel seems to be quite cautious of me. Although not as much as the monkey, this eel is smarter than other monsters. That alone makes it hard for me to act.</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Thought Acceleration LV2] has become [Thought Acceleration LV3]}<br/>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Foresight LV2] has become [Foresight LV3]}</p>
        <p>The eel moved matching the voice of heaven. Wriggling its body, and strike with its tail. Of course I evade it. But, the eel's attack doesn't ends there. Immediately, its tail sweep sideways to attack me. I fall back further and evade it. This time it pulls back its tail, and it go towards me.</p>
        <p>I have been waiting for that.</p>
        <p>In the somewhat slow world caused by the "Thought Acceleration", I stare at the approaching eel's mouth. I judge that I can avoid it, so I activate "Poison Synthesis" at the last moment. I withdraw at once.</p>
        <p>It's the same strategy used on the catfish. But, the effect is tremendous. The eel taste my Deadly Poison as planned.</p>
        <p>The eel's HP decreases rapidly. The painfully struggling eel acts violently in random. I withdraw from the range of its rage.</p>
        <p>In the end, if both have the offensive ability of the same one-hit kill, then the one who hits first, wins. If that's the case, then how to make the attack hits? The one with the great strategy will win. In addition, my evasion ability is better than the eel's accuracy. Even if it has the power of "Accuracy" level 10 and "Probability Correction", it won't reach my "Evasion", "Thought Acceleration" and "Foresight" combo. Therefore, when I drag the eel out to the ground, my winning percentage increased a lot.</p>
        <p>But, it's not ended yet. Although I said that it's a one-hit kill, the eel probably doesn't die in that hit. Even the catfish didn't died by a hit, so there's no way the higher rank which is the eel will die. Besides, the eel still has the power of that skill.</p>
        <p>The eel's HP recovers rapidly in front of me.</p>
        <p>[Life Transitionï¼šConsumes SP to recover HP]</p>
        <p>The level 3 technique of "Fire Drake". SP is consumed, and HP recovers equivalent to that. Although it's impossible for it to recover its HP fully with its current SP, it can secure enough HP to endure the Deadly Poison. Furthermore, in the appraisal result of the eel, [Poison Resistance LV1] and [Automatic HP Recovery LV1] are newly added. Still, the poison in its body reduces its HP little by little, but the damage peak ended.</p>
        <p>Well, there's no way that I will wait for its revival without doing anything.</p>
        <p>I wrap the eel's body with the thread that's made as strong as possible. Still, it will probably burn out at once, but it doesn't matter. I just need it to stop the eel's movement for a moment.</p>
        <p>As planned, I succeeded in stopping its movement for a moment. In that moment, I activate "Poison Synthesis" aiming at the eel's face in rapid succession. Many drops of Deadly Poison hit the eel's face.</p>
        <p>The eel tears the thread off and rages. The poison that invaded from the mouth and the eyes decrease the eel's HP without mercy. The speed is not on the level that the newly acquired automatic recovery can do something about it. The power is not on the level that the newly acquired "Poison Resistance" can endure it. This weapon that I have sharpened in my life as a spider is not easy to protect with just a shield that's made instantly.</p>
        <p>The eel that don't have the SP to recover its HP can never endure this attack.</p>
