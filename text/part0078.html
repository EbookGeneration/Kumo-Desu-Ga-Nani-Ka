        <h2>078 - ... It's an amazing skill.</h2>
        <p>The "Concentration" skill that I have expected have reached its max level. Let's appraise the derived skill, "Thought Acceleration".</p>
        <p>[Thought Acceleration：Accelerates the thoughts, and the perceivable time is extended]</p>
        <p>... It's an amazing skill.</p>
        <p>No, isn't this seriously amazing? This, in other words, it's that, right? It means that the flow of time feels slower, right? It's the phenomenon that the top-notch athlete experience it sometimes where the ball looks slow, right? To be able to activate it. Isn't it amazing?</p>
        <p>I activate it immediately. Umu. The activation itself succeeded without any problems. So, how does it feels?</p>
        <p>Hmm? The magma's movement is a little slow? And, there's an uncomfortable feeling. The various senses of the body feels fast and yet slow, it's a strange feeling that can't be said. I try to move my body. Somehow, there's a strange weight like being underwater. Like impatience that can't be moved. So, this is the default of "Thought Acceleration". Recently, because I will get carried away by my speed, when I use my top speed, I should probably activate this.</p>
        <p>Huh? But, this doesn't consumes anything? Neither my MP nor SP has decreased. That means, this is a skill that can be activated continuously, a passive skill? Although it looks like it can be switched between on and off, there's no demerit even though I switch it on continuously? Eh, isn't it amazing?</p>
        <p>I thought it will surely consumes MP. Something like MP is consumed and it can only be activated for a few seconds. No consumption, anytime and anywhere? Isn't this an outrageous skill?</p>
        <p>The demerit is none in particular. If I were to say it, then there's an uncomfortable feeling to get used to this feeling. I might have acquired a unimaginable cheat skill!</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Prediction LV9] has become [Prediction LV10]}<br/>{Conditions met. Skill [Prediction LV10] has evolved into Skill [Foresight LV1]}</p>
        <p>Ah, Prediction-san, bye. Come to think of it, this also was on the brink of reaching max level. Well, although it was a useless skill, did it become useful after evolving?</p>
        <p>[Foresight：The effect of prediction rises. As a result, the possibility of the future can slightly be seen]</p>
        <p>Hmm? The possibility of the future? Eh, what does it means?</p>
        <p>For the time being, activate. Un. This also can be activated without any problems. But, nothing changes?</p>
        <p>Ah, no. Somehow, the magma's movement is a little weird. Some parts are blurred? No, this, it overlaps with what I'm seeing. Is this overlapped part, the one that's called possibility of the future?</p>
        <p>In short, does it means that I'm seeing the future? Well, I can't believe on it because it's just a possibility, but this skill might be useful if I raise it. The magma that overlapped is also few now, so it doesn't seems to be useful.</p>
        <p>Huh? Wait a minute. This also doesn't consume anything? Eh, this is also a passive skill? ... It's an amazing skill.</p>
        <p>I never thought that a treasure will come out from the useless child, "Prediction". I'm sorry, Prediction. It's possible to become competent even if a useless child work hard.</p>
        <p>{Skill proficiency reached. Skill [Appraisal LV8] has become [Appraisal LV9]}</p>
        <p>The head of the former useless child came! Appraisal-sama! How is the level up this time!? Please, let me see at once!</p>
